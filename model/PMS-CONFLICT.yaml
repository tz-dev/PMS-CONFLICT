#  PMS-CONFLICT — PAPER-SPECIFIC APPLICATION SCHEMA (OVERLAY)
#
#  Repository:
#    https://github.com/tz-dev/PMS-CONFLICT
#
#  File:
#    PMS-CONFLICT.yaml
#
#  Schema Version:
#    PMS-CONFLICT_1.0
#
#  Last Updated:
#    2026-01-10
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  PURPOSE AND STATUS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This document defines a paper-specific APPLICATION SCHEMA for the
#  Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS). It formalizes the theoretical arguments
#  of the accompanying paper
#
#    “PMS-CONFLICT — Conflict as Stabilized Incompatibility
#     Under Binding, Time, Cost, and Exposure (Δ–Ψ)”
#
#  by expressing them in a machine-readable, structurally constrained form.
#
#  The schema is an OVERLAY, not a fork or extension of PMS. Its function is to
#  make the conflict lens formally legible while remaining strictly subordinate
#  to the canonical PMS specification.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  RELATIONSHIP TO PMS (NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  - This schema DEPENDS on the canonical PMS base specification
#    (schema_version: PMS_1.1).
#
#  - It does NOT redefine, replace, reinterpret, or extend the eleven PMS
#    meta-axioms (Δ–Ψ).
#
#  - It does NOT introduce new operators, meta-axioms, or dependency relations.
#
#  - It does NOT modify canonical operator order, dependency hygiene, or
#    derived axes (A, C, R, E, D).
#
#  - All references to operators (Δ–Ψ) retain their meanings exactly as defined
#    in PMS.yaml.
#
#  - Any apparent deviations (e.g. “reduced signatures”, “conflict attractors”,
#    “terminal regime”) are overlay-level constructs only and MUST NOT be read
#    as changes to PMS operator logic.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SCOPE OF THE OVERLAY
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This application schema introduces ONLY overlay-level constructs, including:
#
#    - reduced operator signatures (shorthand expressions for analysis),
#    - drift catalogues and drift classes (Σ/Ψ/Ω/Θ failure modes),
#    - scale matrices (Θ-history, institutionalized Χ, application boundaries),
#    - non-operator constructs (e.g. conflict attractors, exposure capture),
#    - example-suite schemas (scene-bound, non-instructional),
#    - amplification overlays (e.g. publicness, misuse gradient).
#
#  These constructs:
#    - amplify or organize existing PMS operators,
#    - never replace generativity with explanation,
#    - never bypass asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), or distance (Χ),
#    - remain descriptive, non-diagnostic, and non-prescriptive.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  VALIDITY GATE — PMS ENTRY CONDITION (APPLICATION-ONLY)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Any USE of this schema as a PMS APPLICATION presupposes acceptance of the
#  canonical PMS entry condition:
#
#    - Χ (Distance):
#        a maintained meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion into verdict,
#        impulse, narrative, or role.
#
#    - Reversibility:
#        all readings are scene-bound, revisable, and configuration-specific;
#        no global person labels or irreversible interpretive claims.
#
#    - D (Dignity-in-Practice):
#        no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or ontological person evaluation;
#        critique is restricted to structural regimes and cost topologies.
#
#  This gate constrains APPLICATION only.
#  PMS itself may be criticized, rejected, or ignored without satisfying it.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  SELF-BINDING AND MODEL HYGIENE (CLARIFICATION)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  In line with PMS.yaml, any application that suspends Distance (Χ),
#  Dignity-in-Practice (D), or Self-Binding discipline (Ψ) in order to enforce
#  truth, legitimacy, authority, or asymmetry is formally INVALID as PMS
#  application—even if PMS terminology is retained.
#
#  PMS-CONFLICT therefore treats all analyses as:
#    - scene-bound,
#    - structurally revisable,
#    - non-psychological,
#    - non-clinical,
#    - non-moralizing.
#
#  Tragedy, non-integrability, and terminal regimes are structural claims,
#  not diagnoses, verdicts, or governance permissions.

  description: >
    APPLICATION PROFILE for PMS that formalizes the PMS–CONFLICT lens: how
    incompatibility stabilizes once binding persists, trajectories accumulate,
    exit/reflection costs rise (Χ becomes priced/asymmetric), and exposure
    converts description into pressure. The profile expresses the paper strictly
    in the canonical operator grammar (Δ–Ψ), without redefining operators or
    altering dependencies. It provides reduced signatures, core drift classes,
    scale/cost overlays (non-operators), and an example-suite schema for repo use.

      PMS-domain stack. It marks the point at which operator-legible description
      remains possible while internal reintegration grammar is exhausted.
      Beyond this point, any continuation is structurally downstream
      (governance, institutionalization, decision, or evaluation).

    terminal_stack_claim: >
      Within the PMS-domain stack used here, CONFLICT is the terminal domain layer:
      beyond maximal Δ–Ψ load under Θ/Ω/Χ, the model yields no further internal
      reintegration grammar—only downstream governance, institutionalization,
      decision, or evaluation.

    structural_full_stop_sentence: >
      This paper does not continue into solutions. It ends where praxis becomes
      tragically legible but no longer integrable.

    non_operator_constructs:
      terminal_regime:
        is_operator: false
        definition: >
          A descriptive regime in which incompatibility remains structurally
          legible under binding, temporality, and asymmetry, while no additional
          internal operator emerges that restores integrability once Σ no longer
          carries under priced or asymmetric Χ.

        note: >
          The terminal regime is not a failure state, not a diagnosis, and not a
          recommendation to act. It is a boundary condition of the descriptive
          grammar itself.

      note: >
        Φ-substitution and conflict attractor stabilization (Α_conflict) may
        continue to evolve descriptively, but they do not reconstitute Σ
        as an internal reintegration operator.

    guardrail_reminder: >
      This projection is a positioning boundary (finite domain layer), not a
      motivational claim, not a prescription, and not an evaluation. Treating the
      terminal regime as a verdict, a mandate, or a failure narrative constitutes
      a misuse of the CONFLICT lens.

    docking_note: >
      Stabilizes PMS as a finite descriptive system and makes the CONFLICT → MIP/IA
      transition explicit as a change of mode rather than a continuation of the
      same grammar.

    note: >
      Optional structural projection of the CONFLICT configuration onto PMS derived axes.
      This is not a maturity score and not a person-level evaluation. It describes
      which axis-tendencies become structurally probable under CONFLICT-regimes,
      especially under Σ-failure, Θ-hardening, Ω-gradients, and priced/asymmetric Χ.

        structural_reading: >
          Awareness tends to increase because constraint regimes become legible:
          drift types separate “what this is” (regime) from “what we want it to be”.
          Θ-history is required to prevent essentialization; Φ acceleration raises
          the need for production-reading over attribute-reading.

        structural_reading: >
          CONFLICT often exhibits high internal coherence within positions (Σ works locally),
          while joint consolidation fails (Σ₁≠Σ₂ / Ψ₁ excludes Ψ₂). Under Θ/Ω pressure,
          Φ drifts from bridging toward substitution, maintaining narrative legibility
          without producing shared Σ.
        typical_failure_modes:
          - "Integration clash (Σ₁≠Σ₂) treated as misunderstanding."

        operator_basis: ["Ω", "Θ", "Ψ", "Χ", "Λ"]
        structural_reading: >
          Responsibility becomes structurally salient because binding persists (Ψ>0) under
          asymmetric exposure/liability gradients (Ω) and path dependence (Θ). Under
          temporal traps and asymmetry lock-in, attribution pressure increases while fair
          comparison can collapse (ρ-collapse); Λ (non-events) becomes load-bearing where
          delays and withheld responses carry structural consequences.

        operator_basis: ["Χ", "Θ", "Ω", "Σ", "Φ"]
        structural_reading: >
          Action is structurally constrained because exit/interruptibility (Χ) is priced or
          asymmetric and because Σ-work does not yield shared continuation. Θ hardening
          converts attempts into costly trajectories; Φ can sustain motion as positioning
          without restoring integrability. Institutionalized Χ can widen or stabilize the
          action corridor by making distance role-external rather than discretionary.
        typical_failure_modes:
          - "Temporal trap: waiting increases irreversibility (Θ closes option space)."
          - "Asymmetry lock-in: one side can act/withdraw cheaply, the other cannot."

        operator_basis: ["Ω", "Θ", "Χ", "Φ", "Ψ"]
        structural_reading: >
          D is a practice constraint (derived axis), not an operator. It remains feasible
          when distance is real (Χ available) and exposure is bounded; it degrades when
          Ω/Θ amplify vulnerability and Φ converts interpretation into pressure. The firewall
          chapters (11, 25) define D as a hard boundary against shaming/ranking, person-near
          labeling, and conversion of recognition into enforcement.
        typical_failure_modes:
          - "Dignity collapse drift: shaming/ranking replaces scene-bound description."
          - "Exposure capture: publicness turns readings into verdicts; revision punished."
