# PMS–CONFLICT

## Conflict as Cost Geometry - Continuity Load, Endpoint Pressure, and Differential Liability Across Roles

**PMS–CONFLICT is a formal application of the [Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)](https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory)** — a generative operator framework (Δ–Ψ) for modelling praxis, asymmetry, temporality, distance, and self-binding.

Where PMS–CRITIQUE reconstructs *critique* as a constrained praxis form, **PMS–CONFLICT reconstructs conflict itself** as a **terminal descriptive regime**: a condition in which incompatibility persists and stabilizes once binding remains active, costs accumulate, distance becomes priced or asymmetric, and reintegration (Σ) no longer carries.

PMS–CONFLICT does **not** treat conflict as a failure of communication, morality, empathy, or will.
It treats conflict as a **structural outcome** of operator constellations under load.

The project builds explicitly on PMS as its canonical foundation and:

* introduces **no new operators**,
* modifies **no operator dependencies**,
* adds **no prescriptions, interventions, or solutions**.

Instead, it shows:

* how incompatibility stabilizes once **Σ fails under Ψ + Ω + Θ with priced Χ**,
* why conflict is **not a temporary breakdown** but a legible regime,
* how **non-events (Λ)**, exposure (Φ), and attractors (Α) replace integration,
* why **distance (Χ)** becomes contested, priced, or delegitimized,
* and why CONFLICT is a **terminal PMS-domain layer**, beyond which only downstream governance or institutional handling remains.

## What PMS–CONFLICT Is

PMS–CONFLICT is:

* A **praxeological grammar of conflict** (not a resolution model)
* A **PMS_1.1–conform application overlay** of the operator set (Δ–Ψ)
* A framework for analysing:

  * conflict as **stabilized incompatibility**, not escalation
  * **binding collisions (Ψ)** and non-viable joint integration
  * **cost topology** under asymmetry (Ω) and time (Θ)
  * **priced or asymmetric distance (Χ)** and exit realism
  * **Λ control**, silence, delay, and withdrawal as structural moves
  * **Φ substitution** and **Α_conflict** stabilization
* A descriptive model that evaluates conflict by:

  * operator carriage (what carries vs. what substitutes Σ),
  * distribution of irreversible vs. continuous costs,
  * exposure gradients and misuse risk,
  * rather than blame, intent, or moral failure.

**Guiding formula:**

> **Non-moral in description /  
> Operator-strict in analysis /  
> Terminal in domain scope**

## What PMS–CONFLICT Is *Not*

PMS–CONFLICT is not:

* A conflict resolution or mediation framework
* A communication or negotiation method
* A theory of who is “right” or “responsible”
* A diagnostic or psychological account of actors
* A justification tool for enforcement, exposure, or coercion
* A governance or policy manual

Conflict is treated as a **structural regime** —
not as pathology, immaturity, or ethical deficit.

## Core Thesis

PMS–CONFLICT argues that:

* Conflict begins where **Σ-consolidation fails under binding** and does not recover.
* Continued integration attempts can **increase cost** rather than restore coherence.
* **Asymmetry (Ω)** and **temporality (Θ)** convert disagreement into persistence.
* **Distance (Χ)** becomes priced, asymmetric, or delegitimized.
* **Non-events (Λ)** and silence become load-bearing control channels.
* **Publicness and exposure** amplify stabilization without changing grammar.
* Beyond a threshold, conflict becomes **legible but non-integrable**.

> Conflict is not the absence of understanding —  
> it is the stabilization of incompatibility under cost.

## Relation to PMS

PMS–CONFLICT is built directly on the **canonical PMS operator grammar (Δ–Ψ)** as defined in  
[`PMS.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory/refs/heads/main/model/PMS.yaml)
(schema_version: `PMS_1.1`).

* No operators are added or redefined
* Dependency hygiene is preserved
* Reduced signatures are explicitly marked as shorthand
* All claims remain **scene-bound, reversible, and non-diagnostic**

Where PMS provides the **grammar of praxis**,  
PMS–CONFLICT specifies how that grammar behaves when:

* incompatibilities persist,
* bindings collide,
* exit and reflection become costly,
* and reintegration is structurally unavailable.

## What You Can Do With PMS.yaml + PMS–CONFLICT.yaml

PMS.yaml gives you the **operator grammar**.  
PMS–CONFLICT.yaml adds a **conflict-specific application profile** that makes several things explicit and comparable:

### 1) Terminal conflict signature (reduced)

PMS–CONFLICT defines a canonical reduced signature for conflict:

* **CONFLICT_terminal_core** = Σ + Ψ + Ω + Θ + Χ

This marks a **terminal descriptive regime**, not a solution boundary.

### 2) Drift catalogue (conflict-specific)

Named, operator-readable drift classes such as:

* binding collision,
* asymmetry lock-in,
* exposure capture,
* dignity collapse,
* conflict attractor stabilization (Α_conflict).

### 3) Cost topology instead of blame

Each chapter closure formalizes:

* irreversible vs. continuous costs,
* endpoint vs. continuity cost positions,
* why roles respond differently under the same structure.

### 4) Institutionalized Χ scaling

Shows why personal steering (“keeping the wheel”) fails without
role-external distance regimes — without prescribing governance designs.

### 5) Application boundary & misuse firewall

Explicit red zones where transfer becomes invalid:

* high publicness,
* low reversibility,
* person-near interpretation,
* exposure-as-enforcement.

### 6) Explicit terminal positioning

CONFLICT is fixed as the **terminal PMS-domain layer**.
Any continuation is a **mode shift**, not further description.

## PMS–CONFLICT YAML (Addon Specification)

This repository includes **PMS–CONFLICT.yaml** as a strict overlay:

* Depends on **PMS_1.1**
* Introduces no new operators
* Defines:

  * reduced signatures,
  * drift catalogue,
  * scale and cost overlays,
  * application boundaries,
  * terminal positioning.

---

## Example Suite (Structural Stress Tests)

The Example Suite illustrates **conflict as regime**, not as failure:

* binding collisions that cannot be integrated,
* silence as control,
* asymmetry lock-in,
* exposure hardening.

Examples are:

* scene-bound,
* non-diagnostic,
* non-prescriptive,
* guarded by **Χ + reversibility + D**.

## Intended Use

PMS–CONFLICT is intended for:

* structural theorists of conflict
* governance and institutional analysts
* researchers of asymmetry, exposure, and irreversibility
* readers seeking a **non-moral language for persistent conflict**

It is **not** intended for resolution promises or enforcement logic.

Any application remains gated by:
**Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)**.

---

## Final Note

PMS–CONFLICT does not explain how to end conflict.

It explains why conflict persists —
and why persistence can be structurally rational.

> Where integration fails under cost,
> legibility remains — but reintegration does not.
