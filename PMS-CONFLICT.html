			<h2>0. Front Matter (Meta / Hygiene / Navigation)</h2>
			<h3>0.0 Versioning, Repo Discipline, Deliverables</h3>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT is authored and maintained as a repository artifact within the PMS ecosystem. It is not a methodological guide, a set of practices, or a procedural framework, but a formally bounded paper whose status, scope, and deliverables are fixed in advance. This positioning is intentional. Conflict analysis is particularly prone to being misread as intervention, advice, or enforcement; therefore, the artifact status of the paper must be explicit before any substantive claims are introduced.</p>
			<p>The paper is delivered as a stable text (Markdown, HTML, and PDF) accompanied by an example suite. Examples are not illustrative anecdotes embedded in the prose. They are stored separately in a dedicated <code>/examples</code> directory and referenced from the text. This separation enforces scene-bounded interpretation, prevents personalization, and allows examples to remain reconstructible without drifting into narrative persuasion.</p>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT depends exclusively on the Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS) as its source of operators, dependencies, and guardrails. It does not modify, extend, or reinterpret PMS operators. Any future YAML artifact associated with PMS-CONFLICT, should one exist, functions only as an application profile and never as an operator modification. By fixing deliverables, dependency relations, and repository placement, PMS-CONFLICT establishes itself as a reproducible analytical artifact rather than a tool or a normative program.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> none (meta)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> PMS (Theory/Repo) as source of truth; examples live in <code>/examples</code> (repo convention)</p>
			<h3>0.1 Entry Condition &amp; Validity Gate (PMS Prerequisite + Stack Literacy)</h3>
			<p>Any application of PMS-CONFLICT presupposes acceptance of distance (Χ), reversibility, and dignity-in-practice (D). These are not ethical aspirations or psychological traits. They are structural conditions that determine whether an analysis remains within PMS validity. Applications that suspend distance (Χ), self-binding (Ψ), or dignity-in-practice (D) in order to enforce truth, clarity, or asymmetry are formally invalid as PMS applications. This condition applies to application, not to critique or rejection.</p>
			<p>In addition to these baseline conditions, PMS-CONFLICT requires stack literacy. Stack literacy is not a reading order and does not require that other domain-layer papers be applied. It names the minimum interpretive competence necessary to read conflict structurally rather than morally. This includes the ability to recognize anticipatory cost and time structures before events crystallize (ANTICIPATION), to understand distance and interruptibility as structural resources rather than failures (CRITIQUE), to accept the persistence of post-moral residue where justification reaches its limits (LOGIC), and to read drift in binding, comparison, and asymmetry without attributing blame or essence (EDEN and SEX).</p>
			<p>Without this literacy, descriptions of conflict are predictably moralized, interpreted as accusations, or mistaken for latent toolkits. The validity gate therefore regulates application, not access. PMS-CONFLICT may be criticized, rejected, or ignored without meeting this gate; it may only be applied while remaining structurally bound by it.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Χ, Ψ, D (validity constraints) + Θ/Ω/Φ (literacy scope)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> global application gate for domain layers; conditions CONFLICT readability without creating dependencies</p>
			<h3>0.2 Scope &amp; Negative Space (“What This Is Not”)</h3>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT is not mediation, conflict resolution, communication training, diagnostics, person typing, enforcement, or governance. These exclusions are structural rather than rhetorical. Conflict, as modeled here, is not a problem to be solved but a state that becomes legible under conditions of asymmetry, temporality, and binding.</p>
			<p>The paper provides an axiomatic grammar of conflict as a tragic structural form of praxis. “Tragic” does not denote emotional intensity or moral failure. It denotes non-integrability under mature conditions, where competing trajectories remain incompatible even when all parties are reflective and constrained. References to other domain layers function solely as optional interpretive anchors. They increase legibility of specific drift patterns but do not operate as prescriptive modules and are not required in order to apply CONFLICT.</p>
			<p>A central descriptive asymmetry follows from this scope. Conflict legibility tends to increase where exposure to irreversible cost is real and cannot be fully neutralized by protective framing. Configurations that maximize safety can buffer, defer, or externalize costs in ways that suppress decisive signals. In such settings, conflict is not absent but structurally illegible, displaced into moralization, narrative substitution, or diffuse tension.</p>
			<p>This is not a call to seek conflict or to increase exposure. It describes a legibility gradient: where conflict already exists, exposure-proximal configurations can preserve signals that protection-maximized configurations tend to filter or displace. Legibility is not license: increased signal visibility never authorizes suspension of Χ, reversibility, or dignity-in-practice (D). Where exposure conditions make distance or reversibility unavailable in practice, PMS application is invalid even if conflict becomes more visible.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> none (meta)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> scope firewall preventing drift into governance (MIP/IA), therapy, or enforcement; blocks “exposure-as-recommendation” misread</p>
			<h3>0.3 Three Strata (Non-Mixing) — Canonical Stack Frame</h3>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT operates within a strictly separated three-strata architecture. At the base, PMS provides the generative grammar of operators (Δ–Ψ), their dependencies, derived axes, and guardrails. Domain layers, including CONFLICT, apply this grammar as analytic lenses. They do not introduce procedures, recommendations, or governance mechanisms. Downstream from the domain layers, MIP/IA translates legible structures into evaluation, profiling, and institutional handling.</p>
			<p>These strata are non-mixing by design. Domain layers do not govern, enforce, or evaluate. Governance layers do not redefine operators or retroactively moralize structures. This separation is a stability condition rather than an organizational convenience. When strata collapse, conflict analysis mutates into justification, enforcement, or narrative weaponization.</p>
			<p>By fixing CONFLICT firmly within the domain-layer stratum, the paper preserves its descriptive force while preventing both upward leakage into governance and downward contamination of the operator grammar.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> meta-separation (strata discipline)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> prevents spec drift (PMS) and tool-misuse drift (MIP/IA contamination)</p>
			<h3>0.4 Macro Overview Snapshot (Orientation Frame)</h3>
			<p>Within the PMS ecosystem, PMS-CONFLICT occupies the position of a major knot. It addresses stabilized incompatibility of practice trajectories rather than episodic disagreement or correctable error. Its central question concerns how conflict persists as a state under binding, time, and asymmetry, rather than how it can be resolved.</p>
			<p>Structurally, PMS-CONFLICT sits downstream of CRITIQUE, emerging where interruptibility and correction viability are no longer sufficient, and upstream of tragedy handling and downstream institutionalization. The operators most typically under load in this domain are integration (Σ), self-binding (Ψ), asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), and distance (Χ). This placement clarifies that CONFLICT is neither an extension of critique nor a substitute for governance, but a distinct analytic regime.</p>

			<h3>0.5 Publicness Scale and Public Misuse Gradient</h3>
			<p>Conflict analysis is highly sensitive to publicness. PMS-CONFLICT therefore distinguishes levels of public exposure and treats publicness as a structural modifier rather than a moral concern. As publicness increases, the probability that analysis will be personalized, weaponized, or politicized rises accordingly.</p>

			</tbody></table>
			<p>Publicness is a context descriptor. It does not increase or decrease truth. It changes exposure conditions and therefore hardening requirements.</p>
			<h4>0.5.2 Validity Rule A (Publicness Constraint)</h4>
			<p>On P3 and P4, PMS-CONFLICT is valid for public use only under strict depersonalization:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Only aggregated statements and configuration markers.</li>
			<li>No person-near vignettes, no reconstructible individual trajectories, no role-near identifiers.</li>
			<li>No labels that can be used as identity anchors for group formation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is an exposure constraint, not a restriction on analysis itself. The analysis may exist privately; public transmission has stricter admissibility.</p>
			<h4>0.5.3 Validity Rule B (Hardening Increases With Publicness)</h4>
			<p>As publicness increases, the following constraints must tighten:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>stronger reversibility phrasing (claims remain updateable and scene-bound),</li>
			<li>stricter non-labeling discipline (no person-global or group-global predicates),</li>
			<li>narrower term definitions (reduce metaphor drift),</li>
			<li>stricter “what this is not” reinforcement.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Hardening is treated as a structural necessity under exposure, not as a rhetorical posture.</p>
			<h4>0.5.4 Public Misuse Gradient (Distinct From Publicness)</h4>
			<p>Publicness describes where the analysis is shown. Misuse gradient describes how easily a statement can be converted into weaponizable narratives under exposure.</p>
			<table class="table">
			<thead>
			<tr>
			<th>Misuse Gradient</th>
			<th>Description (structural)</th>
			<th>Typical Failure Mode Under Exposure</th>
			</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody><tr>
			<td>low</td>
			<td>primarily structural; hard to personalize</td>
			<td>readers stay at configuration-level</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>medium</td>
			<td>metaphor drift likely; ambiguous operators become story hooks</td>
			<td>moralization via analogy and simplified causality</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>high</td>
			<td>personalizable; group-forming; role-label compatible</td>
			<td>identity anchoring (“us vs them”); accusation reading</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>critical</td>
			<td>media-ready; politicizable; slogan-compatible</td>
			<td>compression into verdicts and enforcement rhetoric</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>Publicness and misuse gradient interact: higher publicness amplifies the downstream effects of high misuse gradient. PMS-CONFLICT regulates exposure by tightening admissibility and hardening rules where the combination becomes structurally explosive.</p>
			<p>Explosivity is not a moral problem. It is a Φ/Α effect that arises when recontextualization and attractor dynamics interact with exposure. PMS-CONFLICT regulates exposure conditions, not truth claims.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Φ, Α, Ω, □ (with Θ as amplifier)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> hardening interface for safe publication; supports A&amp;H-style artifact responsibility without entering governance</p>
			<h3>0.6 Attack Surfaces and Hardening Backlog</h3>
			<p>Given its subject matter, PMS-CONFLICT anticipates predictable misreads. These are treated as structural attack surfaces: places where language or framing is likely to be converted into non-model uses under pressure (publicness, identity anchoring, or narrative compression).</p>
			<h4>0.6.1 Attack Surfaces (Expected Misreads) and Counter-Anchors</h4>
			<table class="table">

			<th>Attack Surface (misread)</th>

			</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>Counter-anchors are not arguments for being right. They are containment mechanisms for predictable recontextualizations.</p>
			<h4>0.6.2 Hardening Backlog (Operational Revision Triggers)</h4>
			<p>Hardening is explicit and iterative. Terms are narrowed where drift occurs. Reversibility anchors are strengthened when exposure rises. Examples are further depersonalized when misuse recurs. Precision is treated as a stability condition for the artifact under reuse.</p>
			<p>Revision triggers (structural, non-empirical):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a recurring misread persists at P2 (institutional), tighten exposure constraints in 0.5 and strengthen the non-tooling clause in 0.2.</li>
			<li>If misuse repeatedly appears at P3/P4 (public/media-amplified), downgrade example admissibility to aggregated-only and raise the required hardening level in 0.5 (misuse gradient handling).</li>
			<li>If a term repeatedly drifts into moral language, narrow the definition and add an explicit negative definition (“what it is not”) in 0.2 and/or 0.7.</li>
			<li>If readers treat formulas as prescriptions, strengthen 0.7 notation rules and add an explicit recognition-only reminder at the start of the first substantive chapter (Part II entry).</li>
			<li>If operator labels are used as person-level predicates in downstream discourse, strengthen non-labeling discipline, add a depersonalization rule for examples, and tighten the publicness constraints.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These triggers describe when the artifact must be hardened to remain usable under exposure, not what any actor should do in a conflict.</p>
			<h4>0.6.3 A&amp;H Compatibility (Second-Order Quality Overlay)</h4>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT is a domain paper, not a governance system. However, its hardening logic is compatible with the A&amp;H precision overlay used in MIPractice: attack points describe vulnerabilities of the analysis artifact, and hardening actions specify minimal next-iteration patches. This overlay targets analysis quality of the artifact itself, not the modeled actors, and it does not evaluate persons, intentions, or live conflicts.</p>
			<p>A minimal precision checklist for this paper’s own hardening passes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Key terms defined (working definition + scope/exclusions).</li>
			<li>Role/context/level/publicness stated where claims are made.</li>
			<li>If/then conditions stated where thresholds are implied.</li>
			<li>Observation vs. evaluation separated; inferences marked.</li>
			<li>Reversibility/update conditions stated.</li>
			<li>Language hygiene preserved (no person-global labels; no shaming; careful risk phrasing).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This paper does not score itself. It uses the checklist as an internal consistency discipline to keep the artifact critique-ready and misuse-resistant.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> meta-hardening; Φ/□ as risk carriers (with Α under exposure)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> bridges scope firewall (0.2) to later application overlays without entering governance</p>
			<h3>0.7 Notation and Conventions (Reading Protocol)</h3>
			<p>Throughout the paper, operator symbols such as □, Δ, Σ, Ψ, Ω, Θ, Χ, Φ, Λ, and Α are used strictly as structural operators and state constraints. They do not denote psychological states, motivations, or traits. When an operator is described as “under load,” this indicates an active constraint regime, not a dominant cause, not a fault attribution, and not a recommendation about what should be changed.</p>
			<p>The paper models states and trajectories rather than isolated events. Formulas and signatures function as recognition grammar, not as interventions. Examples are scene-bound, depersonalized, and subject to the validity gate and exposure constraints defined earlier. These conventions are necessary to prevent symbol-as-metaphor readings and to maintain structural legibility across contexts.</p>
			<p><strong>Symbol collision guard:</strong> Latin <strong>A</strong> denotes the derived axis <em>Awareness</em>, while Greek <strong>Α</strong> denotes the operator <em>Attractor</em>; these are distinct symbols and must not be conflated typographically or semantically.</p>
			<p>This paper also uses a small set of <strong>paper-local markers</strong> for legibility. These markers are <strong>not PMS operators</strong> and must not be read as additional axioms:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>ρ (reciprocity marker):</strong> a local symbol used only to label <em>reciprocity legibility</em> transitions (e.g., “ρ-collapse”). It is descriptive shorthand, not an operator.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ-substitution:</strong> shorthand for a regime in which recontextualization (Φ) increasingly functions as a <em>substitute for Σ-bridging</em> (integration across trajectories), rather than as a step toward consolidation.</li>
			<li><strong>Α_conflict:</strong> shorthand for an attractor configuration in which conflict persistence stabilizes as a recurrent pattern. It does not add structure beyond Α; it only labels the attractor as conflict-stabilizing in context.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>0.7.5 Paper-Local Markers (Non-Operators)</h4>
			<p>This paper occasionally uses <strong>configuration markers</strong> that are <strong>not</strong> PMS operators. They are shorthand labels for recurrent load patterns or transitions expressed in the canonical operators (Δ–Ψ). They must not be read as added axioms, psychological categories, or prescriptions.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>ρ-collapse (reciprocity loss)</strong> is a paper-local marker for a transition in exchange legibility and cost topology. It is expressed via operator interactions (typically □/Λ/Ω/Θ with Φ acceleration), not as an extra operator.</li>
			<li><strong>Α_conflict</strong> is a paper-local label for an attractor configuration where <strong>Α</strong> stabilizes a conflict regime under sustained load (typically with Ω/Θ/Λ/Φ/Ψ). It does not extend PMS; it names a recurrent attractor pattern.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ-substitution</strong> is a paper-local shorthand for cases where recontextualization (Φ) functions as the dominant carrier of legibility and continuation <strong>in the absence of Σ as consolidator</strong>. It does not redefine Φ; it names a regime-level functional shift under load.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>Part I — Stack Position &amp; Definition</h2>
			<h3>Chapter 1 — Central Question &amp; Core Claim (CONFLICT as Major Knot)</h3>
			<p>Conflict, in PMS-CONFLICT, is defined as a <strong>stabilized incompatibility of practice trajectories</strong>. It is not an episode, not an escalation, and not a communicative failure. It is a state in which multiple trajectories remain structurally coherent on their own terms, yet cannot be integrated into a single, shared continuation without violating core constraints.</p>
			<p>This definition rejects event-based and affect-based models of conflict. Conflict does not begin when voices rise, positions harden, or norms are violated. It becomes legible when integration fails <em>despite</em> distance, reflexivity, and structural maturity. Conflict is therefore compatible with competence, responsibility, and dignity-in-practice. Its persistence is not evidence of immaturity, but of structural saturation.</p>
			<p>Within the PMS stack, CONFLICT occupies the position of a <strong>major knot</strong>. It emerges downstream of CRITIQUE, where distance (Χ) and interruptibility are already available, and where recontextualization (Φ) and integration (Σ) have been attempted. Conflict marks the point at which these operators no longer suffice to restore a unified trajectory. What stabilizes instead is incompatibility itself.</p>
			<p>Several operators are simultaneously under load in this state. Integration (Σ) is active but non-convergent: it continues to synthesize locally while failing globally. Self-binding (Ψ) maintains commitment to divergent trajectories rather than dissolving them. Temporality (Θ) extends incompatibility across time, transforming it from a transient blockage into a durable condition. Asymmetry (Ω) distributes exposure, cost, and decision capacity unevenly across role positions. Distance (Χ) remains operative, preventing collapse into coercion or fusion, but also preventing forced resolution.</p>
			<p>The tragedy clause of PMS applies directly at this level. Structural maturity does not guarantee integrability. Under certain constellations, continued reflection, restraint, and responsibility increase clarity without increasing compatibility. Conflict, in this sense, is not a failure mode of praxis but one of its terminally legible forms.</p>
			<h4>1.1 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that conflict is established as a <strong>state of stabilized non-integration</strong>. Integration attempts remain available but do not converge on a shared continuation, while distance, self-binding, and temporal extension remain intact. The frame shifts from correctable misalignment to persistent incompatibility under mature constraint conditions.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs distribute asymmetrically across role positions. Proximity to endpoint-setting concentrates irreversible decision and liability exposure, while continuity-facing positions carry ongoing, cumulative relational and maintenance load. Temporal extension converts local incompatibility into durable exposure differences rather than dissolving them.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under this cost topology, continued integration attempts, formal separation, or stabilization of parallel trajectories are all structurally rational responses, depending on cost proximity. Termination of integration is rational where further synthesis becomes irreversibly expensive, while maintenance of parallel continuities is rational where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, moral failure, or psychological deficit. It does not imply that conflict should be resolved, endured, or valorized. It describes a structural condition in which incompatibility persists under maintained distance, responsibility, and restraint.</p>
			<h3>Chapter 2 — Why CONFLICT Is Not CRITIQUE (Hinge Separation)</h3>
			<p>CRITIQUE and CONFLICT occupy adjacent but non-overlapping positions in the PMS stack. Confusing them collapses the hinge on which the grammar turns. PMS-CONFLICT therefore fixes this boundary explicitly.</p>
			<p>CRITIQUE is defined by <strong>Χ-stabilized interruptibility</strong>. Distance is available at low cost, frames remain permeable, and integration failures are treated as provisional. Correction is viable because trajectories are still plastic. Divergence appears as disagreement, error, misalignment, or incomplete synthesis, but the assumption of eventual reintegration remains structurally intact. Σ is active and convergent, Ψ is not yet binding at the trajectory level, and exit options remain comparatively cheap.</p>
			<p>CONFLICT begins where these conditions no longer hold.</p>
			<p>The transition point is not escalation, emotional intensity, or loss of civility. It is structural. CONFLICT emerges when <strong>integration outcomes diverge</strong> in a stabilized way: <strong>Σ₁ ≠ Σ₂</strong>. Multiple integrations succeed locally but fail globally. Each trajectory is coherent on its own terms, yet incompatible with the others under shared continuation.</p>
			<p>At this point, <strong>self-binding (Ψ)</strong> is partially set. Commitments have crystallized enough that reversal is no longer cost-neutral. Distance (Χ) remains available but becomes <strong>costly and asymmetrically distributed</strong>. Maintaining reflexive restraint now carries unequal exposure across role positions. Exit, interruption, or reframing no longer resets the field; they generate downstream costs rather than restoring critique conditions.</p>
			<p>Asymmetry (Ω) and temporality (Θ) act as pressure multipliers in this hinge. Ω distributes decision authority, exposure, and liability unevenly, while Θ extends incompatibility across time, converting local divergence into path-dependent persistence. Under these conditions, CRITIQUE cannot be re-entered without additional loss. What stabilizes is not misunderstanding but incompatibility itself.</p>
			<p>CRITIQUE therefore fails <em>successfully</em> into CONFLICT. The failure is not epistemic or moral. It is the exhaustion of a regime in which interruptibility and correction were sufficient. CONFLICT names the next regime: one in which integration collisions are no longer resolvable without violating existing bindings or imposing non-reversible costs.</p>
			<h4>2.1 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that the boundary between CRITIQUE and CONFLICT is crossed when interruptibility ceases to be cost-neutral and integration outcomes diverge without reconvergence. Σ remains operative but non-convergent, Ψ becomes partially binding at the trajectory level, and Χ persists as a constraint with asymmetric cost.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs shift from reversible correction costs to irreversible trajectory and commitment costs. Endpoint-adjacent positions absorb decision and liability exposure, while continuity-facing positions absorb extended relational and follow-on load. Temporal extension amplifies these differences rather than smoothing them.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under this cost topology, attempts to re-enter CRITIQUE are structurally rational only where additional loss remains reversible. Where reintegration becomes irreversibly expensive, stabilization of incompatible trajectories, formal separation, or bounded continuation are structurally rational outcomes rather than failures of critique.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about fault, stubbornness, moral rigidity, or communicative failure. It does not imply that conflict should have been avoided or that critique was mishandled. It describes a structural hinge where a correction regime exhausts its viability under binding and cost pressure.</p>
			<h3>Chapter 3 — Definition Set (Terms and Minimal Formal Object)</h3>
			<p>This section fixes the minimal vocabulary required to speak about CONFLICT without drift into psychology, morality, or intervention logic. Definitions are structural, scene-bound, and operator-consistent. They do not describe motives, traits, or intentions. They specify positions, trajectories, and cost relations.</p>
			<p><strong>Conflict</strong>
			Conflict is a <strong>stabilized incompatibility of practice trajectories</strong> under conditions of binding, asymmetry, and temporal extension. It is not an event, escalation, or failure of communication. Conflict names a state in which multiple integrated trajectories persist while remaining mutually non-integrable.</p>
			<p><strong>Competition</strong>
			Competition is a <strong>comparative relation within a shared frame</strong> where trajectories remain mutually legible and reversibility remains structurally available. Losses are substitutable, and exit does not collapse reciprocity. Competition may be intense, but it remains organized by comparative exchange rather than by non-integrable cost topology.</p>
			<p><strong>Non-collapse rule (competition vs conflict)</strong>
			Competition remains competition as long as trajectories remain mutually comparable within a shared frame, and as long as losses can be compensated or substituted without forcing a trajectory break. Competition becomes conflict only when incompatibility stabilizes under binding and time, such that comparison no longer organizes continuation and exit begins to generate non-substitutable downstream costs.</p>
			<p><strong>Incompatibility</strong>
			Incompatibility denotes <strong>non-integrability of outcomes under shared continuation</strong>. It does not imply hostility, error, or ill will. Incompatibility becomes conflict only when stabilized through binding and temporal extension, such that local coherence persists while global convergence fails.</p>
			<p><strong>Trajectory</strong>
			A trajectory is a <strong>temporally extended path of praxis</strong> that becomes legible through sustained framing, pattern stabilization, and asymmetry-aware continuation. A trajectory is not a plan or an intention; it is an enacted sequence under constraint. Minimal recognition grammar:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>a trajectory is a Θ-extended continuation of framed enactments (□ under Θ),</li>
			<li>stabilized by recurrent patterning (Α),</li>
			<li>and typically shaped by role and exposure gradients (Ω).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A minimal operator signature for a trajectory is therefore:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Trajectory T := Θ ∘ Ω ∘ Α ∘ Λ ∘ □ ∘ ∇ ∘ Δ</strong> (with Σ/Ψ optionally appearing later as consolidation).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Binding</strong>
			Binding refers to <strong>constraint fixation and commitment stabilization</strong> that renders reversal non-neutral in cost terms. Binding is not identical with preference, agreement, or declared intention. Binding is present when a trajectory has become committed such that:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>reversing it would require non-trivial recontextualization (Φ) and re-integration (Σ),</li>
			<li>and would generate follow-on costs distributed across role positions (Ω under Θ).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Binding becomes decisive in conflict when self-binding (Ψ) has partially set at the trajectory level, meaning that continuation is no longer merely a choice among options, but a maintained commitment that shapes identity, obligations, or institutional persistence.</p>
			<p><strong>Cost Gradient</strong>
			A cost gradient describes the <strong>uneven distribution of exposure, liability, and follow-on load</strong> across role positions. Cost gradients are structural effects of Ω under Θ. They specify who is near irreversible endpoint costs and who is forced into continuous relational or maintenance costs. Cost gradients are not negotiated preferences and not moral rankings; they are constraint topologies.</p>
			<p><strong>Tragic Collision</strong>
			A tragic collision occurs when <strong>multiple mature, coherent trajectories remain incompatible</strong> and cannot be integrated without violating existing bindings or imposing non-reversible costs. Tragedy denotes non-eliminability under maintained distance and responsibility constraints, not emotional intensity and not moral failure.</p>
			<h4>Minimal Conflict as Structural Object (Non-Psychological)</h4>
			<p>Minimal conflict is not an affective episode and not a breakdown of communication. It is a structural object defined by components and constraints.</p>
			<p>A minimal conflict object can be represented as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>K := (T₁, T₂, F_shared?, B, G, Χ_cost)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>where:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>T₁, T₂</strong> are trajectories (Θ-extended, internally coherent continuations),</li>
			<li><strong>F_shared?</strong> indicates whether the trajectories still inhabit a shared operative frame (□) or have become frame-divergent (□₁ ≠ □₂),</li>
			<li><strong>B</strong> is the binding level (Ψ partially set at the trajectory level; reversal is non-neutral),</li>
			<li><strong>G</strong> is the cost gradient topology (Ω-distributed exposure and liability under Θ),</li>
			<li><strong>Χ_cost</strong> indicates that distance (Χ) remains available as a validity constraint, but its use is costly and/or asymmetrically distributed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Minimal recognition conditions (necessary and jointly sufficient for minimal conflict legibility):</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Divergent integrations:</strong> <strong>Σ₁ ≠ Σ₂</strong> while each trajectory remains locally coherent (Σ-active locally).</li>
			<li><strong>Binding is non-neutral:</strong> <strong>Ψ is partially set</strong>, so reversal produces non-trivial downstream costs.</li>
			<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> incompatibility continues under <strong>Θ</strong>, not as a single incident.</li>
			<li><strong>Asymmetric cost topology:</strong> <strong>Ω produces a non-trivial cost gradient</strong> for exit vs continuation.</li>
			<li><strong>Distance remains a constraint:</strong> <strong>Χ is available</strong>, but cannot be used to force convergence without violating reversibility or creating coercive spillover.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>A compact signature can be stated as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>CONFLICT := (Σ₁ ≠ Σ₂) ∧ (Ψ_partial) ∧ (Θ_persistent) ∧ (Ω_gradient) ∧ (Χ_available_as_constraint ∧ Χ_costly_or_asymmetric)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is recognition grammar for a state, not a prescription and not an intervention protocol.</p>
			<h4>Conflict Levels (Decouplable)</h4>
			<p>Conflict may appear on multiple levels that are <strong>structurally decouplable</strong>. “Decouplable” means that stabilization on one level is neither necessary nor sufficient for stabilization on the others; different frames, bindings, and exposure conditions may operate simultaneously.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Internal conflict:</strong> incompatibility between bound trajectories within a single role system. Decoupling criterion: an internal incompatibility may persist even when interpersonal coordination remains functional, because the binding and cost topology are carried inside a single role-space rather than across roles.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Interpersonal conflict:</strong> incompatibility between trajectories across interacting roles. Decoupling criterion: interpersonal incompatibility may stabilize even when neither party carries it publicly or institutionally, because the shared frame remains local and the cost gradient is concentrated in the relational continuation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Public conflict:</strong> incompatibility stabilized through institutional frames and exposure conditions. Decoupling criterion: public incompatibility may persist even when interpersonal relations are cooperative or neutral, because institutional binding, exposure, and audience-facing constraints stabilize incompatible trajectories independently of private coordination.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These levels may coexist, reinforce, or diverge. None presupposes the others.</p>
			<h4>Reciprocity Loss (ρ-Collapse)</h4>
			<p><strong>Reciprocity loss (ρ-collapse)</strong> denotes a structural transition in which <strong>reciprocal expectation and exchange legibility collapse</strong>. Comparison ceases to organize interaction, and cost topology replaces symmetry assumptions.</p>
			<p>Minimal recognition conditions for ρ-collapse (non-psychological):</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Exchange legibility fails:</strong> actions no longer function as interpretable “moves” within a reciprocal exchange frame (□), and comparison ceases to predict continuation.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost accounting replaces reciprocity:</strong> continuation is increasingly organized by who can carry which costs under Ω, rather than by reciprocal balancing.</li>
			<li><strong>Reversal loses buffering:</strong> attempts to “reset” the exchange do not restore legibility; they create additional downstream costs under Θ.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Under ρ-collapse:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω</strong> sharpens cost gradients (who can absorb what becomes decisive),</li>
			<li><strong>Σ</strong> no longer converges across trajectories (integration diverges instead of reconverging),</li>
			<li><strong>Φ-substitution</strong> accelerates (Φ increasingly substitutes for Σ-bridging rather than enabling consolidation),</li>
			<li>and conflict stabilizes via recurrent patterns (<strong>Α_conflict</strong> as a conflict-stabilizing attractor configuration).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>ρ-collapse does not imply betrayal, bad faith, or moral failure. It marks a shift from integrable comparison to non-integrable cost structure. EDEN may increase legibility of this shift by tracking drift and pseudo-symmetry motifs, but EDEN is not a dependency and introduces no operators or validity conditions into CONFLICT.</p>
			<h4>3.1 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that conflict is defined as stabilized incompatibility of coherent trajectories under binding and time. Integration does not disappear; it diverges across trajectories. The minimal conflict object becomes legible when divergent integrations persist under partial self-binding, asymmetric cost gradients, and costly distance. Reciprocity loss marks the shift from comparative exchange legibility to cost topology, increasing the probability that incompatibility stabilizes as a recurrent attractor.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs relocate from reversible comparison losses to irreversible trajectory and commitment costs. Endpoint-adjacent positions absorb decision and liability exposure, while continuity-facing positions carry extended relational and temporal load. Reciprocity collapse intensifies these asymmetries by removing exchange-based buffering and by converting interpretive exchange into cost-bearing continuation.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under these conditions, continuation, separation, bounded coordination, or formal stabilization of incompatibility are structurally rational outcomes depending on cost proximity and exposure. Attempts to restore reciprocity are structurally rational only where reversal remains non-terminal, where Φ-substitution has not become dominant, and where cost gradients remain containable rather than path-dependent under Θ.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about motives, trustworthiness, maturity, or moral standing. It does not imply that reciprocity should have been preserved, that collapse indicates wrongdoing, or that any specific handling is preferable. It describes structural transitions from comparative exchange to stabilized cost regimes, and it treats EDEN as an optional legibility lens rather than a dependency or a normative program.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>Part II — Operator Grammar: Conflict as a State</h2>
			<h3>4. Frame Dynamics (□): Conflict as a Frame-Drift Regime</h3>
			<p>Conflict is not itself a “frame.” In PMS-CONFLICT, conflict is a <strong>frame-drift regime</strong>: a condition in which the operative frame changes its constraint logic under pressure from asymmetry (Ω), temporality (Θ), integration attempts (Σ), and self-binding (Ψ). The decisive point is not that frames change, but that <strong>frame transitions become unmarked</strong>—and therefore misread as intention, moral stance, or character.</p>
			<p>Frames (□) in PMS are contextual constraint fields: they structure relevance, role-space, expectations, and what counts as a valid move. In conflict, □ does not collapse into one stable configuration. Instead, competing trajectories repeatedly re-embed the situation through Φ, producing drift sequences in which what “this is” changes while participants keep acting as if it remained the same.</p>
			<h4>4.1 Canonical Drift Patterns (Regime Shifts)</h4>
			<p>The following drift patterns are canonical in the sense that they are recurrent structural transitions in conflict regimes. They are not prescriptions and not psychological claims.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Cooperation → Competition drift</strong>
			<strong>□coop → Φ → □comp</strong>
			A cooperative frame is re-embedded into a comparative allocation frame. The same moves change meaning because success criteria shift from shared continuation to relative advantage.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Discursive → Power drift</strong>
			<strong>□discursive → Ω↑ → □power</strong>
			A discourse frame remains linguistically intact while Ω rises: exposure, liability, and decision authority become unevenly distributed. The scene begins to behave like a power frame even if it is still spoken as “conversation.”</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Relational → Identity drift</strong>
			<strong>□relational → Ψ↑ → □identity</strong>
			A relational maintenance frame shifts into an identity/binding frame: positions become commitment-coded. Disagreement becomes read as instability of self-binding rather than as a negotiable relational variation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Conflict → Tragic drift</strong>
			<strong>□conflict → Θ↑↑ → □tragic</strong>
			Temporal extension amplifies irreversibility and cost gradients. The frame shifts from “incompatibility we might still coordinate” to “incompatibility that cannot be integrated without terminal loss.”</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These patterns describe structural reclassification: the same content can move across frames, changing its effect without requiring a change in motives.</p>
			<h4>4.2 Non-Static Frame Axiom (Drift is Normal)</h4>
			<p>No frame remains static. Drift is a normal consequence of the operator grammar once Θ and Ω become significant and once Ψ and Σ are active.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Θ extends sequences into trajectories, making earlier moves constraint-bearing for later interpretation.</li>
			<li>Ω sharpens exposure gradients, making some moves more expensive for some role positions than for others.</li>
			<li>Σ continues attempting coherence under pressure, often producing locally coherent but globally incompatible continuations.</li>
			<li>Ψ stabilizes commitments, increasing the cost of changing what a move “counts as.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conflict therefore tends to generate <strong>multiple concurrent frame candidates</strong>. Drift is not evidence of pathology. It is the expected behavior of praxis under binding and cost pressure.</p>
			<h4>4.3 Rule of Failure: Frames Fail When Transitions Are Unmarked</h4>
			<p>Frames do not “fail” because they change. They fail when <strong>frame transitions occur without being marked</strong>—i.e., without explicit recognition that the constraint regime has shifted.</p>
			<p>Unmarked drift produces predictable structural distortions:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Intent attribution drift:</strong> a frame shift is read as manipulation rather than re-embedding (Φ misread as motive).</li>
			<li><strong>Moralization drift:</strong> a regime shift is read as virtue/vice rather than as constraint change (Ω misread as moral status).</li>
			<li><strong>Identity capture:</strong> a frame shift is read as “who someone is” rather than as which bindings are under load (Ψ misread as essence).</li>
			<li><strong>Pseudo-discourse:</strong> discursive language persists while the scene operates as power distribution (□discursive language masking □power mechanics).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Marking a drift is not an intervention rule; it is an analytic requirement for keeping claims scene-bound and non-psychological. If drift remains unmarked, conflict becomes rapidly personalizable and therefore vulnerable to misuse—especially under elevated publicness.</p>
			<h4>4.4 Docking: Where Frame-Drift Becomes Legible — Limits, Binding Domains, and Downstream Boundaries</h4>
			<p>Frame-drift regimes do not float freely in the stack. They become most legible at specific <strong>dock points</strong>, and they become most misuse-prone when strata collapse. PMS-CONFLICT therefore treats docking not as “what to do next,” but as <strong>where the same regime is structurally likely to be interpreted through a neighboring lens</strong>.</p>
			<h5>4.4.1 Docking to LOGIC (Discursive Limits)</h5>
			<p>Frame drift often begins inside a discursive frame (□discursive), but becomes non-discursive in practice when justification reaches structural limits:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Under sustained Ω/Θ pressure, discourse increasingly functions as <strong>a carrier of positions</strong> rather than as a correction medium.</li>
			<li>Σ-probes (attempts to integrate) continue locally while failing globally; residue remains.</li>
			<li>Λ accumulates as unaddressed non-events (missing acknowledgements, missing repairs, missing reciprocation) that cannot be dissolved by additional argument.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At this dock point, the relevant shift is not “irrationality.” It is that the scene crosses from <strong>discursive correctability</strong> into <strong>post-closure residue</strong>: explanation may remain possible while integrability becomes unavailable. This is the LOGIC boundary: what remains when justification no longer produces shared continuation.</p>
			<h5>4.4.2 Docking to SEX (and other high-Ψ/high-Ω domains)</h5>
			<p>Certain domains are structurally high-load on Ω and Ψ: exposure is real, exit is costly, and binding is not merely procedural.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Relational frames (□relational) tend to drift into identity-coded frames (□identity) quickly because Ψ is not optional in practice; it is continuously tested by trajectory moves.</li>
			<li>Χ becomes expensive or unevenly affordable: distance can appear as abandonment, cost-shift, or threat to continuity, depending on role position and exposure gradient.</li>
			<li>Φ-substitution becomes frequent: re-embedding is used to protect viability (“this is not about X, it is about Y”), but repeated Φ without Σ convergence can stabilize attractors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This dock point clarifies why some conflicts resist “communication fixes” without implying pathology: the scene is governed by binding thresholds and exposure gradients, not by missing skill.</p>
			<h5>4.4.3 Optional Docking to EDEN (Comparison Drift and Reciprocity Collapse)</h5>
			<p>EDEN is not a dependency of CONFLICT, but it can increase legibility when conflict regimes drift into comparison and pseudo-symmetry.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Where reciprocity collapses (ρ-collapse), interaction ceases to be organized by exchange legibility and becomes organized by cost topology.</li>
			<li>Under such conditions, frames often drift into comparative registers (status, fairness, rank, “who gives more”), even if no actor explicitly chooses that lens.</li>
			<li>Φ-substitution accelerates because comparison frames provide an immediately legible narrative substitute for complex cost gradients.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This docking is <strong>optional and diagnostic-only</strong>: it helps explain why conflict becomes readable as “comparison,” but PMS-CONFLICT does not require EDEN to define the conflict state.</p>
			<h5>4.4.4 Downstream Boundary: CONFLICT → Governance / Evaluation (MIP / IA)</h5>
			<p>As publicness increases, frame-drift regimes are increasingly vulnerable to being re-used as sanction narratives or person labels. The downstream boundary is therefore not about truth, but about <strong>artifact handling</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>PMS-CONFLICT remains domain-layer description: it does not score, diagnose, or recommend enforcement.</li>
			<li>MIP / IA is the downstream discipline that decides whether an analysis is transmissible, misuse-resistant, and zone-appropriate (green/yellow/red).</li>
			<li>Crossing this boundary without explicit guardrails is a structural misuse risk: drift descriptions become justification for coercion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This boundary is not an instruction to “apply MIP.” It is a stack hygiene reminder: conflict legibility is not governance entitlement.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> □, Φ, Ω, Θ, Ψ, Σ
			<strong>Docking:</strong> connects to LOGIC (discursive limits) and SEX (identity/binding); EDEN optional for comparison drift; downstream boundary to MIP/IA for evaluation/governance handling</p>
			<h4>4.5 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that conflict operates as a <strong>frame-drift regime</strong>: the operative frame shifts under Φ/Ω/Θ/Ψ/Σ pressure rather than remaining stable. Conflict is not a frame but a condition in which multiple frame candidates compete through re-embedding and binding, becoming most legible at dock points where neighboring regimes (discursive limits, high-binding domains, comparison drift) constrain interpretation.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p><strong>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</strong></p>
			<p>Costs increase when drift is unmarked because role positions become exposed to mismatched constraint assumptions. Under Ω and Θ, the price of “staying in the wrong frame” is distributed unevenly: some positions pay via liability and endpoint costs, others via continuity and relational maintenance load. Ψ hardening amplifies these asymmetries by making reclassification itself costly.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under frame-drift regimes, it is structurally rational that actors attempt to stabilize a frame, re-embed the scene, or withdraw into narrower constraint fields depending on cost proximity. Stabilization is rational where a shared constraint regime still yields viable continuation; re-embedding and narrowing are rational where the current frame makes reversibility or dignity-in-practice structurally unavailable. Docking shifts are rational where the scene has crossed into discursive limits or high-binding exposure conditions.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about manipulation, bad faith, moral failure, or psychological traits. Drift is not treated as blameworthy; it is treated as a normal consequence of operator interaction. Docking references are stack-position markers, not recommendations. The failure condition is unmarked transition, not change itself.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>5. Temporality (Θ): Trajectory Mechanics (Temporal Trap / Path Dependence)</h3>
			<p>Temporality (Θ) is not “time passing.” In PMS-CONFLICT it names the structural fact that praxis becomes a <strong>trajectory</strong>: sequences accumulate, options narrow, and actions become non-local because they bind what comes next. This is the pressure amplifier of conflict. Where CRITIQUE can still treat divergence as interruptible and correctable, CONFLICT experiences time as a constraint regime: the scene becomes expensive to rewind, expensive to re-interpret, and expensive to leave.</p>
			<h4>5.1 Θ in CRITIQUE vs Θ in CONFLICT</h4>
			<p>In CRITIQUE, Θ typically functions as a <strong>support for correction viability</strong>. The temporal dimension allows a sequence to be revised: a move can be re-embedded, a misunderstanding can be repaired, an interruption can be integrated. Under sufficient Χ and Σ capacity, the trajectory remains elastic. The past can be recontextualized without collapsing the present.</p>
			<p>In CONFLICT, Θ functions differently. The trajectory becomes <strong>path-dependent</strong>: earlier moves do not merely “happen before,” they become structural constraints that delimit what can be plausibly integrated now. Even if all actors remain capable of reflection, Θ changes the shape of the scene by making reversibility progressively less available in practice.</p>
			<p>This shift is not psychological. It is a cost topology: time converts local incompatibility into cumulative load, and cumulative load converts divergence into stabilized incompatibility.</p>
			<h4>5.2 Temporal Trap: When Time Becomes a Lock</h4>
			<p>A temporal trap is a Θ-regime in which each additional unit of time changes the scene in coupled ways:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><p><strong>Option space shrinks.</strong>
			Plausible branches disappear. What could have been a low-cost correction earlier becomes a high-cost reversal later. The system loses “cheap exits.”</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Costs reclassify from relational to irreversible.</strong>
			What could have been repaired through Σ-work increasingly converts into terminal consequences: reputational exposure, institutional commitments, binding commitments, or irreversible coordination effects.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Self-binding hardens trajectories.</strong>
			Ψ does not merely stabilize continuity; it stabilizes the cost of reversal. Under Ψ load, changing course becomes a rupture in commitment continuity and therefore structurally expensive.</p>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In such regimes, conflict does not “escalate” as a mood. It stabilizes as a durable state because Θ makes continued divergence cheaper than reintegration.</p>
			<h4>5.3 Irreversibility and the Shrinking Reversibility Budget</h4>
			<p>Reversibility is not a moral ideal; it is a structural budget. In conflict, that budget shrinks under Θ because:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>commitments become embedded in frames (□) that cannot be rewound without cost,</li>
			<li>asymmetry (Ω) concentrates exposure and liability unevenly, so reversal is not equally affordable,</li>
			<li>distance (Χ) becomes costly because stepping back can itself generate downstream costs, missed deadlines, or loss of positional viability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is where “more discussion” becomes an unreliable diagnostic. Discussion may still occur, but the trajectory has already become a cost-bearing object. The scene has moved from disagreement to constraint.</p>
			<h4>5.4 Asynchronous Frame-Time Positions</h4>
			<p>A core feature of conflict temporality is <strong>asynchrony</strong>: actors can inhabit different frame-time points simultaneously.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>One role position may still treat the scene as early-stage and correctable (CRITIQUE-time).</li>
			<li>Another role position may already experience the trajectory as late-stage and non-reversible (CONFLICT-time).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not primarily a factual misunderstanding. It is a mismatch of temporal position. Asynchrony produces predictable structural effects:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Misalignment of what counts as “still possible.”</strong>
			One side proposes integrative moves that are structurally unavailable to the other due to accumulated costs.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Conflict over the legitimacy of distance.</strong>
			Χ is experienced as necessary where correction viability still exists, but as cost-shifting where late-stage constraints already dominate exposure.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Compression effects.</strong>
			When Θ is experienced as urgent by one role position, it can force premature endpoint-setting, accelerating Ψ hardening and increasing Ω exposure.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Asynchronous frame-time positions are a central reason conflict cannot be reduced to “different perspectives.” The perspectives are anchored in different temporal regimes.</p>
			<h4>5.5 Θ as Pressure Amplifier: Why Time Makes Conflict Legible and Hard</h4>
			<p>Θ increases legibility by forcing trajectories into visibility: accumulated non-events (Λ), repeated patterns (Α), and cost gradients (Ω) become harder to deny as time extends. At the same time, Θ makes conflict harder by converting what could be integrable divergence into stabilized incompatibility. Time functions as an amplifier because it increases both signal and price.</p>
			<p>This chapter positions Θ as the mechanism by which conflict becomes a state rather than a series of episodes: a trajectory that cannot be reset without structural loss.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Θ, Ψ, Ω (path costs), Χ (exit cost)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> leads to the Attractor chapter</p>
			<h4>5.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that temporality (Θ) converts divergence into trajectory constraints: option space shrinks, reversibility budgets degrade, and earlier moves become binding constraints on present legibility. Asynchronous temporal positions can coexist within one scene, producing conflict that is not reducible to perspective difference but to mismatched trajectory regimes.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p><strong>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</strong></p>
			<p>Costs concentrate where role positions are exposed to late-stage irreversibility and liability effects, while other role positions remain nearer to early-stage correction affordances. Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs tend to experience Θ as a lock, while role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs tend to experience Θ as ongoing load under shrinking affordability.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, continued integration work is structurally rational where the reversibility budget remains non-exhausted and where Σ can still consolidate trajectory differences without terminal rupture. Where Θ has already converted key branches into irreversible commitments, formalization, withdrawal, or stabilization of incompatibility becomes structurally rational as a response to shrinking option space rather than as a defect of will or maturity.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not imply that urgency is virtue, delay is failure, or that any actor should choose a particular timing. It describes structural consequences of Θ under conflict conditions: how time amplifies cost, reduces reversibility, and produces asynchronous trajectory positions without psychologizing or prescribing.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>6. Conflict Attractor (Α_conflict): Why Conflict Stabilizes (Not “Escalates”)</h3>
			<p>A common descriptive error is to treat conflict as a linear escalation curve: more tension, more heat, more breakdown. PMS-CONFLICT treats this as a category mistake. Conflict is not primarily a rising intensity; it is a <strong>stabilization regime</strong>. Once incompatibility becomes trajectory-stable under binding (Ψ), temporality (Θ), and asymmetry (Ω), the conflict state begins to function like an attractor: it reduces uncertainty, organizes attention, and produces predictable role behavior. In that sense, conflict can be “better” than ambiguity without being “good.”</p>
			<p>Here, <strong>Α_conflict</strong> is used strictly as a <strong>configuration label</strong>: an attractor regime in which <strong>Α</strong> stabilizes conflict trajectories under load. It makes no claim about intention, strategy, or character.</p>
			<p>The attractor claim does not moralize conflict. It states a structural function: conflict becomes a low-entropy coordination substitute when Σ-work is non-viable or prohibitively expensive. Where integration would require re-binding, re-framing, or reallocation of costs, the conflict attractor provides an alternative: a coherent orientation field that does not resolve incompatibility but makes it navigable.</p>
			<h4>6.1 Conflict Provides Order (Orientation, Role Stabilization, Predictability)</h4>
			<p>In the conflict regime, the scene becomes legible through a narrowed interpretive channel. Actors do not need to negotiate the full complexity of the situation to act within it. The attractor supplies:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Orientation:</strong> what matters, what counts as a move, what counts as a threat, what counts as “already decided.”</li>
			<li><strong>Role stabilization:</strong> stable positions emerge (initiator, resister, adjudicator, witness, carrier, endpoint-setter, continuity-holder) without requiring explicit agreement.</li>
			<li><strong>Predictability:</strong> sequences become easier to forecast because the conflict frame compresses option space; deviations become costly, and repetitions become reliable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This stabilization is structurally attractive under Θ pressure. Time punishes open-endedness. The attractor reduces the cognitive and coordination load of remaining in a partially integrated state where neither reintegration nor separation has been structurally consolidated.</p>
			<h4>6.2 Attractor Mechanisms: How Stabilization Is Produced</h4>
			<p>The conflict attractor stabilizes through coupled mechanisms. These mechanisms are not personality patterns. They arise from operator interactions under load.</p>
			<ol>
			<li><p><strong>Role fixation under Ω and Ψ</strong>
			Once asymmetry gradients and binding commitments are active, roles become costly to exit. Positions harden because leaving them changes the cost topology rather than merely changing the conversation. Role fixation is therefore not stubbornness; it is an Ω/Ψ constraint effect.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>“Everything is evidence” under Φ-substitution</strong>
			When Φ replaces Σ as the consolidator, new information is embedded into the conflict frame rather than integrated across frames. Events and non-events become confirmatory material. The attractor does not need proof; it needs placement. This produces a self-sealing structure without requiring bad faith: the frame can absorb novelty by re-encoding it.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Attention lock-in under Θ and Λ</strong>
			Θ keeps unresolved trajectories salient because past moves remain constraint-bearing. Λ adds structured absence: missing responses, delayed decisions, unacknowledged transitions, withheld clarifications. These absences are not empty; they become load-bearing points that keep attention tied to the conflict object and prevent clean re-entry into a correction regime.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Relief from Σ-work</strong>
			Integration is expensive. It requires holding contradictions, recontextualizing without weaponization, and potentially redistributing costs. The conflict attractor offers relief: it removes the demand for synthesis by converting complexity into stable incompatibility. This relief is a structural payoff, not a moral advantage.</p>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These mechanisms explain why conflicts can remain stable even when actors are reflective and constrained. Stability is not a failure of maturity; it is an equilibrium produced by operator load and cost distribution.</p>
			<h4>6.3 Avoidance-as-Conflict: Silence and Non-Communication as Active Binding</h4>
			<p>In PMS-CONFLICT, avoidance is not automatically “no conflict.” Silence and non-communication can function as active moves when they redistribute costs and bind trajectories.</p>
			<p>A non-response can:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>create Λ points that carry expectation structure (silence as structured absence),</li>
			<li>impose asymmetric waiting costs (time is spent carrying uncertainty),</li>
			<li>force other role positions to either continue carrying coordination load or to formalize endpoints,</li>
			<li>prevent frame transitions from being marked, thereby stabilizing drift and role fixation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Avoidance becomes conflict when it is not mere absence, but <strong>structured absence</strong> that changes trajectory constraints. It can stabilize Α_conflict by maintaining ambiguity while preserving asymmetric cost distribution: the scene remains unresolved, but not free.</p>
			<h4>6.4 Instrumental Conflict: Conflict Used as an Unclean Cut</h4>
			<p>Conflict can also function as an “unclean cut” when deeper non-integration would require high-cost Σ-work. The conflict attractor then provides simplification: it creates a stable incompatibility that is easier to inhabit than a prolonged attempt at integration.</p>
			<p>Instrumental conflict is not a claim about intention or manipulation. Structurally, it describes cases where:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>an incompatibility cannot be integrated without re-binding or cost redistribution,</li>
			<li>the system requires a stable orientation to proceed,</li>
			<li>conflict provides that stability without requiring genuine synthesis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In such regimes, conflict is not chosen as a preference. It emerges as a stabilizing substitute when the integrative path is structurally unaffordable or when the costs of “keeping it open” exceed the costs of an unclean, stabilized incompatibility.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Α, Ω, Θ, Λ (residues), Φ, Ψ
			<strong>Docking:</strong> explains later group and narrative sections</p>
			<h4>6.5 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that conflict can stabilize as an attractor regime: it supplies orientation, role fixation, and predictability when integration (Σ) is non-viable or prohibitively expensive. Stabilization is produced by coupled dynamics of Φ-substitution, Λ-based structured absences, Θ pressure, and Ω/Ψ cost constraints, rather than by linear escalation.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p><strong>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</strong></p>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs tend to experience the conflict attractor as a stabilization device because it reduces uncertainty and compresses decision space. Role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs tend to experience the attractor as persistent load because stabilization does not resolve incompatibility and often shifts carrying work into ongoing coordination, waiting, or repair. Avoidance-as-conflict redistributes costs by converting absence into asymmetric waiting and exposure.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, remaining within the conflict attractor is structurally rational where Σ-work would require irreversible cost redistribution or binding rupture, and where stabilization provides a workable orientation field for continuing trajectories. Exiting the attractor is structurally rational where stabilization becomes irreversibly expensive, where Λ-based absences accumulate into non-integrable constraint points, or where formalization reduces downstream costs relative to continued ambiguity. Instrumental conflict is structurally rational where an unclean cut produces lower cumulative cost than prolonged attempted integration.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not imply that conflict is desirable, that avoidance is morally defective, or that stabilization proves bad faith. It describes structural response patterns under asymmetric cost conditions in which conflict functions as an attractor: a stabilization regime that can persist without psychologizing, prescribing, or assigning blame.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>7. Recontextualization Under Load (Φ): Φ Replaces Σ</h3>
			<p>In PMS, Φ is a transformation operator: an existing configuration is embedded into a new frame so that trajectories can continue under changed conditions. In CRITIQUE, Φ typically functions as a bridge to Σ. Recontextualization expands the shared field and can make integration possible: Φ produces additional structure that Σ can consolidate.</p>
			<p>In CONFLICT, this bridge function degrades. The system does not lack perspectives; it lacks a viable consolidation corridor. Under binding pressure (Ψ), asymmetry gradients (Ω), and temporal compression (Θ), recontextualization becomes a substitute for integration rather than a precursor. Φ continues to operate—often with high intensity—but its outputs no longer feed Σ. Instead, Φ becomes the main carrier of legibility inside the conflict attractor. The scene remains interpretable, but it is interpreted through embedding and repositioning rather than through synthesis.</p>
			<p>This is a structural substitution: <strong>Φ replaces Σ as consolidator</strong>. Where Σ would require cross-role cost redistribution or binding revision, Φ can maintain movement by re-encoding the scene in a way that preserves local viability for a given role position.</p>
			<p>This is not a claim about dishonesty or “spin.” It is a regime description: embedding (Φ) remains available when synthesis (Σ) is structurally blocked or unaffordable.</p>
			<h4>7.1 Φ in CRITIQUE vs Φ in CONFLICT (Functional Divergence)</h4>
			<p>In CRITIQUE, Φ is constrained by interruptibility and correction viability. Recontextualizations remain answerable to the shared frame: they are expected to converge toward a more coherent configuration, even if slowly. Φ remains oriented toward repairing the integrative pathway.</p>
			<p>In CONFLICT, correction viability is structurally degraded. Recontextualization no longer needs to converge. It needs only to stabilize a trajectory under incompatible commitments. This is the hinge: Φ remains operational, but its output is no longer designed to be consolidated. Stability is achieved through <strong>continued embedding</strong> rather than <strong>synthesis</strong>.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>CRITIQUE:</strong> Φ expands interpretive options so that Σ can consolidate.</li>
			<li><strong>CONFLICT:</strong> Φ expands or shifts interpretive options so that Σ becomes unnecessary, unaffordable, or structurally blocked.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>7.2 Φ as Positioning: Canonical Types Under Conflict Conditions</h4>
			<p>Under conflict conditions, recontextualization becomes a primary mechanism of positioning. The types below are not exhaustive and are not claims about intent. They describe recurrent structural moves that become available when Σ is absent as consolidator.</p>
			<ol>
			<li><p><strong>Motive reframing</strong>
			The trajectory is stabilized by relocating meaning into a motive-account. The scene becomes legible through an internal-cause narrative rather than through shared constraints. This often increases person-attribution risk without requiring that anyone “wants” to psychologize.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Historization</strong>
			Present constraints are embedded into a longer temporal story such that the current configuration appears predetermined by earlier segments. The function is not historical truth but path-locking: alternative continuations become structurally implausible.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Context inflation</strong>
			The frame is widened until local obligations and scene-specific constraints lose binding force. Embedding the scene into a larger context displaces immediate costs and allows continuation without consolidation. The cost is increased interpretive volatility: “what this is” keeps shifting.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Moralization without moral theory</strong>
			The frame is re-encoded in value terms without a stable normative system. This is not moral philosophy. It is a stabilizer under non-integrability: moral salience is used to fix a trajectory when Σ cannot produce shared coherence. The function is positioning, not rigorous justification.</p>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Across these types, the shared effect is stable movement without integration: coherence becomes local to frames rather than shared across them.</p>
			<h4>7.3 Damage-to-License Conversion (Ω → Φ): From Prior Cost to Present Narrative Authority</h4>
			<p>A characteristic conflict move is the conversion of prior asymmetry exposure into present interpretive license. The structural pattern is:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>prior Ω produced real exposure or cost,</li>
			<li>that prior cost is recontextualized into a present entitlement to interpret, demand, withdraw, or override,</li>
			<li>the entitlement stabilizes the trajectory within the conflict regime.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a moral claim about what anyone deserves. It is a description of how accumulated asymmetry can become narrative authority without passing through integration. Typical signatures include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>the past cost is treated as sufficient to settle present ambiguity,</li>
			<li>settlement occurs through embedding (Φ), not through synthesis (Σ),</li>
			<li>stability is produced via license rather than coherence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this regime, the conflict attractor can harvest its own history as fuel: prior exposure becomes part of the recontextualization engine that sustains the present frame.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Φ, □, Ω (with Σ absent as consolidator)
			<strong>Docking:</strong> into drift typology</p>
			<h4>7.4 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that recontextualization (Φ) can shift from a bridge-to-integration function into a consolidation substitute: Φ maintains legibility and trajectory viability in the absence of Σ. The conflict regime stabilizes through frame embedding and placement rather than through synthesis of incompatible structures.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Role positions with high exposure to irreversible or cumulative costs tend to carry more recontextualization pressure because Φ becomes the primary mechanism for keeping trajectories viable without forcing immediate consolidation. Role positions near endpoint-setting costs can use Φ to stabilize a decisive frame, while role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs experience Φ as ongoing interpretive load and cost displacement. Damage-to-license conversion shifts past asymmetry exposure into present narrative authority, redistributing interpretive costs without resolving them.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, Φ-substitution is structurally rational where Σ would require non-affordable cost redistribution, binding revision, or irreversible concessions, and where Θ pressure demands immediate legibility. Counter-moves are structurally rational where Φ inflation increases downstream costs: formalization can reduce interpretive volatility, and withdrawal can be rational where continued embedding amplifies non-integrability and accumulates irreversible cost.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, manipulation, or normative preference. It does not assert that recontextualization is dishonest, that moral language is inherently illegitimate, or that any role position is morally superior. It describes structural response patterns under conflict conditions in which Φ can replace Σ as a consolidator, producing stability through embedding and positioning rather than through integration.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 8 — Minimal Forms and the Non-Conflict Border</h3>
			<p>This chapter draws a sharp border around the object named <strong>conflict</strong> in this paper. The goal is not to police language, but to prevent a predictable collapse: calling every collision, disagreement, or unpleasant exchange “conflict,” and thereby losing the structural signal.</p>
			<h4>8.1 Canonical border confusions</h4>
			<p><strong>Conflict ≠ competition.</strong>
			Competition can remain integrable: it can be contained within a shared frame, with reversible losses, and with a stable possibility of coordination. Competition may be intense while still preserving a shared <strong>Σ-space</strong> (coherence possibility) and a viable <strong>Χ-space</strong> (interruptibility and reflective distance).</p>
			<p>Conflict begins where the underlying trajectories no longer share an integrable spine.</p>
			<p><strong>Conflict ≠ critique.</strong>
			Critique is a regime in which interruption remains structurally possible and correction remains structurally viable. It can be harsh, but it remains oriented toward reintegration. In critique, Φ functions as a bridge back into Σ rather than a substitute for it.</p>
			<p>Conflict begins where interruption no longer restores a shared Σ-space, and where “repair attempts” become costs that compound.</p>
			<p><strong>Conflict persistence ≠ escalation.</strong>
			Persistence can be stabilizing. A conflict can remain in a stable orbit without increasing intensity because it is held by an attractor: it provides orientation, role stabilization, and predictability. What increases is not necessarily heat; what increases is structural lock-in.</p>
			<h4>8.2 Minimal conflict as a structural object</h4>
			<p>A minimal conflict state can be represented as a constraint bundle rather than an event:</p>
			<p><strong>C := ⟨Σ₁, Σ₂, Ψ_partial, Ω_gradient, Θ_persistent, Χ_exit_costly/asymmetric⟩</strong>, where:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Σ₁ ≠ Σ₂</strong>: integration spines are incompatible (not merely different preferences).</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ_partial</strong>: binding is non-trivial (commitments, identity load, institutional roles, public positioning, or durable obligation).</li>
			<li><strong>Ω_gradient</strong>: an asymmetry exists in exposure, capacity, or liability (even if subtle).</li>
			<li><strong>Θ_persistent</strong>: trajectories exist and option space can shrink (path dependence).</li>
			<li><strong>Χ_exit is costly and/or asymmetric</strong>: reflective distance and exit are not freely available without significant loss.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conflict is not defined by hostility, volume, or emotional intensity. It is defined by the presence of a <strong>stabilized incompatibility under binding, time, and cost</strong>.</p>
			<h4>8.3 Minimal falsification vignette</h4>
			<p><strong>Scene (depersonalized):</strong>
			Two role positions within a shared frame enter a heated dispute about a decision. The interaction shows sharp disagreement, raised intensity, and strong language. A short interruption occurs (pause, separation, or procedural reset). After the interruption, both role positions return to the shared decision procedure, explicitly revise their respective claims, and converge on a coherent joint action without carrying forward identity-level binding or retaliatory accounting.</p>
			<p><strong>Why it looks like conflict:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>intensity is high,</li>
			<li>language is adversarial,</li>
			<li>the momentary frame appears combative.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Why it is structurally not conflict:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Σ remains viable</strong>: there is an available path to coherent consolidation.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ remains effective</strong>: interruption changes the state rather than compounding costs.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ does not harden</strong> into trajectory-fixating binding.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ does not convert the episode</strong> into a durable lock-in regime.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This vignette installs a falsifier: high intensity is insufficient. The object is the <strong>constraint regime</strong>, not the affect signature.</p>
			<h4>8.4 Boundary case: conflict exposure under power</h4>
			<p>A frequent border failure occurs when one role position can impose exposure while another cannot decline exposure without cost. In such cases, conflict may become visible for one role position earlier than for others, because “not participating” is not equally affordable.</p>
			<p>This is not a claim about motives. It is an <strong>Ω-shaped exposure</strong> fact: when exposure is forced, conflict can be sustained even if one side attempts to treat the situation as critique or competition. The key structural signal is <strong>asymmetric exit</strong>: Χ becomes costly, uneven, or functionally unavailable in practice.</p>
			<h4>8.5 Impulse collision (non-conflict)</h4>
			<p>An <strong>impulse collision</strong> is a collision of directional tensions (∇) within a frame (□) that produces friction, frustration, or abrupt disagreement, but does not meet the conflict bundle.</p>
			<p>Typical properties:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>the collision remains local to the scene,</li>
			<li>there is no durable Ψ-load (binding does not harden),</li>
			<li>exit or interruption does not create compounding losses,</li>
			<li>the option space does not collapse into path dependence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Impulse collision can be unpleasant and frequent. It becomes conflict only when it recruits binding, asymmetry, and temporality into a stabilized incompatibility.</p>
			<h4>8.6 Single-actor conflict (structural inclusion via exposure)</h4>
			<p>Conflict can be sustained by a single role position when that role position can bind others into the conflict frame through exposure constraints.</p>
			<p>Structural mechanism (non-psychological):</p>
			<ul>
			<li>one role position repeatedly stabilizes incompatibility by substituting Φ for Σ (placement replaces consolidation),</li>
			<li>other role positions become included not by agreement but by <strong>forced trajectory coupling</strong> (costly exit, reputational exposure, procedural obligation, or institutional/public coupling).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key signal is not one-sided hostility. The signal is <strong>unilateral stabilization of incompatibility under asymmetric exit costs</strong>.</p>
			<h4>8.7 Avoidance-as-conflict border case</h4>
			<p>Avoidance can be structurally active. Silence, non-response, or procedural stalling can redistribute costs and bind trajectories even when no overt confrontation occurs.</p>
			<p>A minimal avoidance-as-conflict signature typically shows:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Λ becomes load-bearing</strong> (absence is structured and consequential),</li>
			<li><strong>Θ amplifies</strong> (delay collapses options, increases sunk cost, or hardens downstream constraints),</li>
			<li><strong>Ω shapes who carries the follow-on load</strong> (one role position must continue operating under uncertainty while another can withhold),</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ hardens indirectly</strong> (identity, commitment, or obligation becomes implicated without an explicit binding act),</li>
			<li><strong>Χ becomes costly/asymmetric</strong> (distance or exit produces additional loss rather than restoring critique conditions).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This case is often misread as “no conflict” because the surface lacks confrontation. Structurally, conflict can already be stabilized by non-events that compound costs.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load (typical):</strong> Ω, Θ, Ψ, Λ (with □ as the constraint field; Φ as a frequent substitution path; Σ as the absent consolidator once the border is crossed).
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to Part III (drift typology) by fixing “conflict” as a falsifiable structural object and specifying canonical misclassification corridors.</p>
			<h4>8.8 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>A boundary condition is structurally established: <strong>conflict</strong> is a <strong>constraint regime</strong> (stabilized incompatibility under binding, temporality, asymmetry, and costly/asymmetric exit), not affect intensity, adversarial language, or momentary collision. A minimal formal object is fixed as <strong>⟨Σ₁≠Σ₂, Ψ&gt;0, Ω&gt;0, Θ&gt;0, Χ_exit costly/asymmetric⟩</strong>, and an explicit falsifier is installed: <strong>high intensity without constraint lock-in is not conflict</strong>. Border operators for recurrent misclassification are specified: <strong>Λ becomes load-bearing in avoidance-as-conflict</strong>, and <strong>Ω-shaped exposure can sustain conflict unilaterally</strong> even when other role positions remain in critique or competition regimes.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs distribute by <strong>exposure and trajectory coupling</strong>, not by declared intent. Irreversible costs concentrate where conflict becomes reified through binding (Ψ), institutional coupling, or public fixation (trajectory hardening, reputational lock-in, procedural non-reversibility). Continuous costs accumulate where ongoing coordination must proceed under contested expectation structures (Λ-residue, ambiguity, repeated Φ-placement). Endpoint and liability costs concentrate in role positions forced into closure under Ω/Θ, while continuity and relational costs concentrate in role positions required to carry ongoing interaction under unresolved constraints.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Structurally rational responses cluster around <strong>classification discipline</strong> and <strong>exposure control</strong> rather than escalation logic. Where hard labeling or public coupling would be irreversibly expensive, bundle-based recognition (constraint signatures) and level-decoupling (internal/interpersonal/public separation) are structurally rational. Where non-classification generates higher downstream costs (Λ-residue, Θ-trap, Ω-exposure), formalization becomes structurally rational as containment (procedural routing, explicit boundary marking, documentation), and withdrawal becomes rational where continued participation merely amplifies non-integrability under costly/asymmetric exit.</p>
			<p>This envelope is descriptive: it names which continuations tend to appear structurally rational under the stated cost topology; it does not recommend operational steps.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This chapter makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not claim that conflict is better than critique, that intensity is bad, that avoidance is wrong, or that unilateral stabilization implies malicious intent. It fixes a falsifiable structural object and clarifies how misclassification, exposure constraints, and non-event residues transform costs and trajectories.</p>

			<h2>Part III — Drift Typology &amp; Tragedy</h2>
			<h3>9. Core Drift Types (Canonical List)</h3>
			<p>This part introduces a repeatable typology for <strong>conflict drift</strong>: how a conflict-state changes its structural regime over time without requiring escalation, moralization, or psychologizing. The point is classification under operator constraints, not solution ethos.</p>
			<p>A “drift type” is a <strong>dominant failure mode of Σ-availability under Θ/Ω/Ψ pressure</strong>, typically stabilized by Α and maintained through Φ-substitution.</p>
			<h4>9.1 Integration Clash (Σ₁≠Σ₂)</h4>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Two integration spines are incompatible in practice. The incompatibility is not reducible to preference variance; it is a <strong>non-coinciding consolidation regime</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural signature (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Σ₁≠Σ₂</strong> remains stable under attempted re-derivation.</li>
			<li>Φ attempts do not converge into shared Σ; Φ becomes substitutional.</li>
			<li>Θ increases the cost of re-attempting consolidation (path dependence).</li>
			<li>Ω determines who can refuse integration attempts without penalty.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Common misread:</strong> treated as “misunderstanding,” “bad communication,” or “lack of goodwill.”
			<strong>What is actually tracked:</strong> whether <strong>coherent joint consolidation exists</strong> under the current binding and cost topology.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Σ, Θ, Ω, Χ (often), Φ (often).</p>
			<h4>9.2 Binding Collision (Ψ₁ excludes Ψ₂)</h4>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Commitments, identity-load, role obligations, or public positioning become mutually excluding. The collision is not about conviction intensity; it is about <strong>incompatible constraint commitments</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural signature (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ψ₁ and Ψ₂ cannot be jointly satisfied</strong> within the same role-space (□).</li>
			<li>Attempts to “integrate” function as implicit rebinding (Ψ-pressure), not as Σ-work.</li>
			<li>Θ hardens the collision by converting temporary positions into durable trajectories.</li>
			<li>Ω shapes which bindings can be maintained without exposure penalty.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Common misread:</strong> treated as “stubbornness” or “ego.”
			<strong>What is actually tracked:</strong> exclusion relations between commitments under role constraints.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Ψ, Σ, Θ, Ω, □.</p>
			<h4>9.3 Asymmetry Lock-In (Exit Costs Asymmetric)</h4>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The conflict-state persists because <strong>exit and distance are structurally uneven</strong>. One role position can change frames, withdraw, or externalize with lower costs than another.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural signature (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ_exit is costly and/or one-sided</strong>; distance is not equally available.</li>
			<li>Formal “options” exist but are non-viable due to asymmetric follow-on costs.</li>
			<li>Θ amplifies sunk costs and compounds exposure.</li>
			<li>Α stabilizes routines that exploit or rely on the asymmetry (without requiring intent claims).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Common misread:</strong> treated as “power struggle” in a moralized domination frame.
			<strong>What is actually tracked:</strong> cost gradients and exposure asymmetry as persistence drivers.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Ω, Χ, Θ, Α (often), □.</p>
			<h4>9.4 Temporal Trap (Time Hardens the State)</h4>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Temporality becomes the primary amplifier: option space shrinks, reversibility degrades, and delayed decisions convert into irreversible constraints.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural signature (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Θ transforms a negotiable state into a trajectory-locked state.</li>
			<li>Non-events (Λ) become load-bearing (delays, withheld responses, deferred procedures).</li>
			<li>Past accommodations become future constraints (path dependence).</li>
			<li>Ω determines who carries delay-costs vs who can impose delay.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Common misread:</strong> treated as “we just need more time.”
			<strong>What is actually tracked:</strong> whether time is <strong>opening</strong> or <strong>closing</strong> structural degrees of freedom.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Θ, Λ, Ω, Ψ (often), Χ (often).</p>
			<h4>9.5 Dignity Collapse Without Moral Failure (D structurally undermined)</h4>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Dignity-in-practice (D) is structurally undermined even when no party is “bad,” irrational, or morally defective. The collapse occurs when the cost topology makes restraint and protection structurally unaffordable or non-credible.</p>
			<p>D is a derived structural axis in PMS (not an additional operator): it names whether dignity-in-practice remains feasible under the current Ω/Θ/Χ regime.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural signature (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Ω increases exposure while Χ becomes expensive or unavailable.</li>
			<li>Σ is absent as consolidator; Φ becomes positioning rather than bridging.</li>
			<li>The interaction regime rewards boundary violation or cost displacement (not necessarily overt hostility).</li>
			<li>Θ converts repeated micro-violations into durable vulnerability structures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Common misread:</strong> treated as “someone is abusive” (which may be true in particular cases, but is not the analytic claim here).
			<strong>What is actually tracked:</strong> whether D can be <strong>maintained as a practice constraint</strong> under the current Ω/Θ/Χ regime.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> D (practice parameter), Ω, Χ, Θ, Φ (often), Σ (often absent).</p>
			<h4>9.6 Outcome Configuration Types (Structural Modifier)</h4>
			<p>Outcome structure does not define drift types, but <strong>modifies stability</strong> and the likelihood of Φ/Α substitution. Use the following as a <strong>modifier layer</strong>:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<thead>
			<tr>
			<th>Outcome Configuration</th>
			<th>Structural Meaning (non-moral)</th>
			<th>Typical Stabilizer</th>
			</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody><tr>
			<td>Mutual loss</td>
			<td>Both sides pay continuous or terminal costs; conflict persists as costly equilibrium.</td>
			<td>Θ + Α (stabilization via predictability)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Mutual gain</td>
			<td>Rare in sustained conflict; typically signals drift back toward critique/competition regimes.</td>
			<td>Σ viability returns</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Unilateral gain / unilateral loss</td>
			<td>Asymmetric payoff combined with asymmetric exposure; persistence often driven by Ω lock-in.</td>
			<td>Ω + Χ_exit asymmetry</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Mixed / delayed payoff</td>
			<td>Costs immediate for one position, deferred for another; often produces Λ-load and Θ-trap.</td>
			<td>Λ + Θ</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody></table>
			<p>This layer is descriptive: it tracks which cost attractors become stable under the current configuration.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Ω, Θ, Α (often), Λ (often).</p>
			<h4>9.7 Reciprocity Loss Marker (ρ-collapse) as a Cross-Cutting Modifier</h4>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Reciprocity loss is the structural collapse of reciprocal expectation and exchange legibility. Once reciprocity collapses, “fair exchange” and “balanced comparison” become <strong>non-legible</strong> inside the frame.</p>
			<p><strong>Structural signature (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Cost comparison becomes unstable or impossible inside the shared □.</li>
			<li>Σ-attempts drift into Φ-substitution (“reasons” replace consolidation).</li>
			<li>Α_conflict stabilizes because reciprocity cannot reconstitute the integrable spine.</li>
			<li>Θ amplifies the loss: repeated non-events (Λ) or repeated substitutions become path-dependent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>ρ-collapse does not replace the drift types; it <strong>intensifies</strong> them by removing a primary reintegration substrate.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Ω, Σ, Φ, Α (often with Θ as amplifier).</p>
			<h4>9.8 Typology Use Rule (Recognition-Only)</h4>
			<p>This typology is used to <strong>name the dominant constraint regime</strong> of a conflict-state at a given time, and to track drift across regimes. It does not assign motives, character, or blame, and it does not imply a prescribed intervention. It is a classification grammar meant to remain stable under publicness and misuse pressure.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load (typical across the list):</strong> Σ, Ψ, Ω, Θ, Χ (with D as a practice parameter in relevant cases).</p>
			<h4>9.9 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that conflict drift is typed as <strong>regime shift in operator availability</strong>, not as an intensity curve. Drift classification fixes which consolidation pathway fails and how persistence stabilizes: integration clash, binding collision, asymmetry lock-in, temporal trap, and structural degradation of dignity-in-practice as a maintained constraint. Where reciprocity loss (ρ-collapse) occurs, comparative legibility degrades and Φ-substitution and Α-stabilization become more probable as persistence carriers.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Irreversible and terminal costs concentrate where Θ and Ω convert attempted consolidation or delayed closure into path-dependent liability and endpoint exposure. Continuous and relational costs concentrate where ongoing coordination must proceed under non-integrable constraint regimes, accumulating Λ-residue and repeated Φ-placement. Where ρ-collapse becomes load-bearing, cost comparison inside the operative frame degrades and cost displacement into narrative or procedure becomes structurally likely without resolving the underlying incompatibility.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under these cost conditions, classification discipline and trajectory decoupling are structurally rational where they reduce compounding costs from repeated non-convergent Σ-attempts. Continued consolidation attempts are structurally rational where remaining reversibility budgets still support shared Σ viability. Formalization, withdrawal, or bounded continuation become structurally rational where further integration work becomes irreversibly expensive and where Φ-substitution and Α_conflict already stabilize persistence as a lower-entropy continuation regime.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, intent, or normative preference. It does not treat any drift type as moral failure or moral superiority, and it does not import governance, diagnosis, or enforcement logic. It describes structural response patterns under asymmetric cost conditions, using the typology as recognition grammar for constraint regimes rather than as an intervention program.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 10 — Tragic Residual Conflicts (Explicit Tragedy Clause)</h3>
			<p>This chapter makes explicit what PMS treats as a core structural claim: <strong>maturity does not eliminate tragedy</strong>. Under certain constellations, reflective distance (Χ), integrative capacity (Σ), and responsible self-binding (Ψ) do not converge toward resolution. They converge toward <strong>clarity of incompatibility</strong>. Conflict can become more legible as maturity rises, without becoming more solvable.</p>
			<p>A “tragic residual conflict” is therefore not an escalation, not a pathology, and not a failure of competence. It is a state in which <strong>coherent trajectories collide over non-substitutable goods</strong> under real asymmetry (Ω) and temporal constraint (Θ), such that integration would require <strong>terminal damage</strong> to at least one binding (Ψ) or one trajectory’s viability.</p>
			<h4>10.1 The Tragedy Clause in Conflict Form</h4>
			<p>In PMS, tragedy is not a mood category. It denotes <strong>non-integrability under mature constraint conditions</strong>. The tragic clause becomes explicit in conflict when:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>multiple trajectories remain coherent on their own terms (Σ works locally),</li>
			<li>the trajectories are mutually non-integrable under shared continuation (Σ₁≠Σ₂ persists),</li>
			<li>commitments are real and binding (Ψ&gt;0),</li>
			<li>asymmetry produces non-uniform exposure and liability (Ω&gt;0),</li>
			<li>temporality converts choices into path-dependent constraints (Θ&gt;0).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here ‘maturity’ names operator-capacity in praxis (Χ/Σ/Ψ handling under Θ/Ω), not a stable property of persons.</p>
			<p>Under these conditions, “more reflection” does not guarantee a joint synthesis. It can instead increase the precision with which incompatibility is seen.</p>
			<h4>10.2 Collision Goods and Non-Substitutable Damage</h4>
			<p>Tragic residual conflicts typically revolve around <strong>collision goods</strong>: goods that cannot be jointly realized within the same continuation, and cannot be traded off without altering the identity and obligation topology of at least one trajectory.</p>
			<p>Collision goods are not “preferences.” They are <strong>binding-relevant</strong> goods. Typical collision classes (structural, not psychological):</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>continuity goods</strong> (maintaining a viable ongoing trajectory),</li>
			<li><strong>integrity goods</strong> (maintaining an integrated spine without internal contradiction),</li>
			<li><strong>obligation goods</strong> (maintaining responsibility gradients without betrayal of role commitments),</li>
			<li><strong>exposure goods</strong> (limiting vulnerability under asymmetric cost topology),</li>
			<li><strong>meaning goods</strong> (maintaining a frame that preserves what counts as real and binding in the scene).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where collision goods are present, damage is often <strong>non-substitutable</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>conceding does not merely “lose a point,” it breaks a binding spine (Ψ rupture),</li>
			<li>“compromise” is not neutral: it can be a forced re-binding under Ω,</li>
			<li>integration attempts can become <strong>reversibility violations</strong> when one side cannot afford the implied costs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is why tragedy is compatible with goodwill. The collision is structural.</p>
			<h4>10.3 No Automatic “IA”: Tragedy Is Not Evaluation</h4>
			<p>A critical misuse risk is to treat tragedy as an implicit diagnosis or an “IA verdict.” PMS-CONFLICT blocks this.</p>
			<p>Tragic residual conflict is not a score and not a label. It does not imply:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>immaturity,</li>
			<li>deficient responsibility,</li>
			<li>bad faith,</li>
			<li>pathology,</li>
			<li>or that one side “should have” integrated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>In MIPractice terms, “IA” means <em>Inadult Asymmetry</em>: a structurally problematic asymmetry flagged when the IA-box criteria are violated — transparency (T), justification (J), time-boundedness (TB), and reversibility (R).</strong></p>
			<p>The tragedy clause blocks an automatic inference from “painful outcome” to “IA”: irreducible collision goods can produce harm even when asymmetries remain legitimate or unavoidable.</p>
			<p>Tragedy is <strong>a structural state description</strong>: under Θ/Ω/Ψ constraints, Σ cannot produce a shared continuation without terminal damage. This may coexist with high discipline and dignity-in-practice; it may also coexist with severe misuse. The tragedy clause does not decide which—<strong>it only fixes that non-integrability can persist even under maturity</strong>.</p>
			<h4>10.4 Conflict Legibility Rather Than Conflict Resolution</h4>
			<p>Because tragedy is structurally possible, PMS-CONFLICT is oriented toward <strong>legibility</strong> rather than “resolution.”</p>
			<p>Legibility means:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>identifying the dominant constraint regime (which drift type governs),</li>
			<li>distinguishing local coherence from global non-integrability (Σ local vs Σ shared),</li>
			<li>tracking where Φ is bridging vs substituting,</li>
			<li>tracking where Θ is opening vs closing option space,</li>
			<li>tracking how Ω distributes exit cost and exposure.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Legibility is not intervention logic. It does not answer “what to do.” It answers “what this is” without collapsing into moral verdicts or psychologizing.</p>
			<p>In tragic residual conflicts, legibility can be the only stable gain: clarity about what cannot be integrated prevents repeated compounding Σ-attempts that behave like cost-amplifiers under Θ/Ω.</p>
			<h4>10.5 Epistemic Boundary: The Knowledge Threshold Link</h4>
			<p>Tragic residual conflict also has an epistemic implication: <strong>certain kinds of domain knowledge cannot emerge where conflict is structurally impossible</strong>.</p>
			<p>If a domain has no real exposure, no binding stakes, and no trajectory cost (low Ω, low Ψ, low Θ), then:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>collisions of goods remain hypothetical,</li>
			<li>incompatibility remains rhetorically solvable,</li>
			<li>and the domain produces “knowledge” that is untested by cost topology.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In such settings, conflict can be discussed, but <strong>tragic structure cannot be known</strong>—because the conditions that generate it do not occur. The knowledge threshold is therefore structural:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>where Ω/Θ/Ψ never become real, domain understanding of tragedy remains thin or moralized,</li>
			<li>where Ω/Θ/Ψ are real, tragedy becomes legible as a constraint phenomenon rather than a failure narrative.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a recommendation to increase exposure. It is a boundary claim about what can become intelligible in a domain without real cost and binding conditions.</p>
			<h4>10.6 Docking: LOGIC and MIP/IA Boundaries</h4>
			<h5>10.6.1 Docking to LOGIC (Post-Moral Residue)</h5>
			<p>Tragic residual conflict often produces <strong>post-moral residue</strong>: a remainder that persists when justification reaches its limit.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>discourse can continue (language remains),</li>
			<li>but justification no longer produces shared continuation,</li>
			<li>and “rightness” becomes non-integrative because collision goods are non-substitutable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the LOGIC dock: tragedy becomes visible precisely where explanation remains possible but integration remains unavailable. Residue is not irrationality; it is what remains when the integrative corridor collapses under real constraints.</p>
			<p>LOGIC denotes the boundary where justification remains possible while shared continuation becomes structurally unavailable.</p>
			<h5>10.6.2 Docking to MIP/IA (Tragedy vs Evaluation)</h5>
			<p>The tragedy clause must not be converted into governance entitlement. <strong>MIP/IA (MIPractice) treats IA = <em>Inadult Asymmetry</em> as a separate downstream check via the IA-box (T–J–TB–R), not as an automatic conclusion from conflict intensity or tragedy.</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>PMS-CONFLICT: names tragedy as a structural possibility, preserving depersonalized legibility.</li>
			<li>MIP/IA: decides whether any analysis is transmissible, evaluable, zone-appropriate, and misuse-resistant.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The boundary is essential: tragedy is a <strong>domain-layer state description</strong>, not a permission slip for scoring, labeling, or enforcement. Where evaluation is necessary (institutional or public contexts), it must be explicitly handled downstream under MIP/IA constraints—without retroactively turning tragedy into blame.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Θ, Ω, Ψ, Σ
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to LOGIC (post-moral residue) and to MIP/IA (tragedy vs evaluation)</p>
			<h4>10.7 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the tragedy clause, it follows structurally that <strong>maturity does not eliminate non-integrability</strong>. Tragic residual conflict is a state in which coherent trajectories collide over non-substitutable goods under Θ/Ω/Ψ constraints such that Σ cannot produce shared continuation without terminal damage. The primary analytic gain is <strong>legibility of incompatibility</strong>, not an implied path to resolution.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs distribute asymmetrically across role positions because Ω shapes exposure and liability, and Θ converts choices into path-dependent constraints. Collision goods create non-substitutable damage: concessions can function as Ψ-ruptures or trajectory viability breaks rather than as reversible losses. Where tragedy is present, repeated Σ-attempts can compound cost rather than reduce it.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under tragic residual conditions, it is structurally rational that actors shift from resolution-expectations to constraint recognition: attempts to force synthesis become unaffordable where they imply terminal damage under Ω/Θ/Ψ. Legibility-focused classification is rational where it prevents compounding costs and clarifies which continuations remain viable without violating reversibility or dignity-in-practice constraints. Domain knowledge tends to thicken where conflict is structurally possible (real Ω/Θ/Ψ), and remains thin or moralized where such conditions never occur.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This chapter makes no claims about character, guilt, manipulation, or normative preference. It does not imply that tragedy equals “IA,” pathology, or moral failure, and it does not authorize enforcement or evaluation. “Collision goods” and “epistemic boundary” are structural claims about non-integrability under Θ/Ω/Ψ constraints. Docking to LOGIC and MIP/IA marks neighboring lenses and downstream handling boundaries, not intervention instructions.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>11. What CONFLICT is not (Second Firewall: Misuse Patterns)</h3>
			<p>This section exists to prevent a predictable failure mode: once conflict is named structurally, readers treat the paper as a license to diagnose, enforce, select, or publicly sort persons. PMS-CONFLICT is not an intervention framework. It is a recognition grammar. The moment it is operationalized as a tool of control, it ceases to be a valid application of PMS, because application is self-bound by distance (Χ), reversibility, and dignity-in-practice (D).</p>
			<h4>11.1 Not mediation, not resolution, not communication training</h4>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT does not provide a path for “fixing” conflicts. It does not offer procedures for reconciliation, negotiation, boundary setting, or repair. The paper models when and why integration becomes non-viable under binding, time, and asymmetry. Any attempt to turn that modeling into a stepwise method is a category error: it converts recognition into governance.</p>
			<h4>11.2 Not diagnosis, not typing, not selection</h4>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT must not be used to label individuals, infer traits, or rank maturity. It does not support psychological attribution, personality typing, clinical diagnosis, or risk assessment. It also does not support institutional selection decisions (“hire / fire / promote / exclude”) under the pretext of structural clarity.</p>
			<p><strong>Red-zone prohibited uses include:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>person-near diagnostics (clinical, therapeutic, forensic, or pseudo-clinical)</li>
			<li>public pillory (narrative prosecution via structural vocabulary)</li>
			<li>selection and sorting (employment, status, inclusion, access decisions)</li>
			<li>“assessment of children” as an application domain (especially any diagnostic inference)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are not cautions. They are formal invalidations: such uses violate the entry condition of PMS application by collapsing distance (Χ) into enforcement and by converting structural operators into person judgments.</p>
			<h4>11.3 Conflict is not moral failure</h4>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT does not treat conflict as a defect, sin, immaturity, or lack of virtue. A conflict state can persist under high competence and restraint because incompatibility can be structurally stabilized by trajectories, commitments, and cost topology. The model’s tragedy clause is not rhetorical. It names that maturity does not guarantee integrability.</p>
			<p>Moral readings are specifically disallowed here because they replace the object: they substitute evaluations for constraint regimes. When conflict is moralized, the analysis drifts from structure (operators under load) into narrative prosecution and identity sorting.</p>
			<h4>11.4 No toolset promise (tools are structural modifiers, not guidance)</h4>
			<p>PMS-CONFLICT does not promise tools, techniques, or leverage. It does not imply that, once a configuration is named, an operator can be “applied” to produce a desired outcome. The availability and controllability of tools is itself a structural modifier:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Under <strong>Ω</strong>, tool access is asymmetrically distributed.</li>
			<li>Under <strong>Χ</strong>, the ability to interrupt or withdraw without compounding cost is not guaranteed.</li>
			<li>Under <strong>Φ</strong>, reframing capacity can either bridge toward Σ (in critique regimes) or replace Σ (in conflict regimes).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this paper, references to “tools” are treated only as constraints on what is structurally available inside a regime. They are not treated as intervention advice, and they cannot be used as justification for coercion.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> guardrail layer (Χ / reversibility / D) with Ω and Φ as typical misuse carriers.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> this firewall prevents drift into governance and prepares later discussion of downstream handling (if any) without turning CONFLICT into an enforcement interface.</p>
			<h4>11.5 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that <strong>misuse is not a secondary risk but a primary failure mode</strong> of CONFLICT-language under exposure. The decisive frame shift is: <strong>recognition grammar → governance interface</strong>. When this shift occurs, <strong>Χ no longer functions as distance</strong>, <strong>reversibility no longer functions as a validity condition</strong>, and <strong>D no longer functions as enacted restraint</strong>. The operator vocabulary remains present while the constraint regime is absent.</p>
			<p>What becomes structurally established is a <strong>firewall boundary</strong>: using CONFLICT as mediation, diagnosis, selection, or enforcement is <strong>formally invalid as PMS application</strong>, because the application collapses into non-distance and non-reversibility. The failure is not an interpretive disagreement; it is a constraint breach.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Costs distribute along <strong>exposure and liability gradients</strong> rather than along “who is right” narratives.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Irreversible costs</strong> concentrate where CONFLICT-language is coupled to <strong>publicness, institutional leverage, or durable record</strong> (selection decisions, reputational capture, procedural labeling).</li>
			<li><strong>Relational costs</strong> concentrate where CONFLICT-language becomes <strong>person-near</strong> (identity adjacency, role fixation, recontextualization-as-license), even if no formal action follows.</li>
			<li><strong>Decision costs</strong> cluster at the point where a role position must decide whether to <strong>treat the analysis as recognition</strong> or <strong>convert it into an action handle</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Follow-on costs</strong> compound where conversion occurs, because subsequent trajectories inherit the new regime (path dependence through Θ + stabilization through Α).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs. Positions with enforceable leverage tend to externalize costs into naming, while positions without leverage tend to carry continuity costs under imposed frames.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under this cost topology, structurally rational responses are defined by <strong>validity preservation</strong> and <strong>cost containment</strong>, not by “improvement.”</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Termination of mediation is structurally rational</strong> where “mediation” has already become a covert governance interface (irreversibly expensive due to exposure/liability coupling). The termination of mediation marks not incapacity, but the end of structural affordability.</li>
			<li><strong>Continued mediation is structurally rational</strong> only where reversibility remains real and where conversion into enforcement is not load-bearing (low liability coupling, low publicness coupling).</li>
			<li><strong>Formalization, withdrawal, and externalization</strong> become structurally rational where person-near interpretation produces predictable downstream costs (e.g., moving analysis to aggregate descriptions, constraining examples, raising depersonalization thresholds, or refusing person-level applicability). These are consequences of asymmetric cost distribution, not defects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, mediation is terminated where it becomes irreversibly expensive and continued where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs.</p>

			<p>This closure makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It describes structural response patterns under asymmetric cost conditions.</p>
			<p>It does <strong>not</strong> imply that anyone “should” avoid conflict talk, that exposure is morally bad, or that restraint is morally superior. It does <strong>not</strong> diagnose motives, traits, or intentions. It does <strong>not</strong> provide an intervention protocol. It states only this: when CONFLICT-language is converted into governance, the validity constraints (Χ, reversibility, D) drop out, and the resulting operation is structurally illegible as PMS application.</p>

			<h2>Part IV — Modern Conditions (Θ-history): why the regime is “young”</h2>
			<h3>12. Why history is required (PMS logical necessity)</h3>
			<p>Conflict mechanics are often misread as essence claims when their <strong>temporal production conditions</strong> are left implicit. PMS-CONFLICT therefore treats “history” not as background narrative, but as a <strong>formal necessity</strong>: without Θ-history, a reader will default to ontological interpretations (“this is how people are”) instead of structural interpretations (“this is how a regime stabilizes under these constraints”).</p>
			<p>In PMS terms, this is not optional. A stabilized pattern is an attractor (Α). An attractor is not a timeless property of a person or a group. It is a <strong>recurrent stabilization</strong> that emerges only under a sufficient configuration of frame constraints (□), non-events (Λ), asymmetry gradients (Ω), temporality (Θ), and recontextualization pathways (Φ). If the enabling configuration is recent or recently intensified, then the attractor field is correspondingly young: it has not had time to sediment into long-run stability, and it will often present as volatile, rapidly re-labeled, and highly sensitive to exposure.</p>
			<p>A “young Α-field” is therefore a structural diagnosis of the regime itself:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Θ is compressed</strong>: trajectories lock in faster, option spaces shrink sooner, and reversibility windows close earlier.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ is accelerated</strong>: structures are re-embedded into new frames at high frequency, so interpretations mutate faster than integration (Σ) can consolidate.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω becomes more legible and more consequential</strong>: exposure and liability gradients are amplified by durable records, procedural coupling, and asymmetric exit costs (Χ_exit).</li>
			<li><strong>Λ accumulates residue</strong>: non-events (silences, delays, missing acknowledgments) become load-bearing because they propagate through extended systems rather than dissolving locally.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The consequence is not “modernity causes conflict.” The consequence is narrower: under a regime with high Θ-pressure and high Φ-frequency, <strong>stabilized incompatibilities become easier to produce and harder to unwind</strong>, and the resulting patterns are prone to being mistaken for timeless properties because their historical enabling conditions are not visible at the surface.</p>
			<p>This chapter therefore uses history as a guardrail against essentialization. It does not claim that the underlying operators are new; it claims that the <strong>composition and scaling</strong> of operator conditions can be new, and that new compositions can generate new stabilizations. Without making Θ-history explicit, CONFLICT is predictably misread as an anthropology of fixed traits rather than as a grammar of regimes.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Α, Θ, Ω, Φ.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to enabling conditions (how the modern constraint field makes specific stabilizations more probable without turning them into essence claims).</p>
			<h4>12.1 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that <strong>Θ-history is a validity constraint against essentialization</strong>: attractor-stabilized conflict patterns (Α_conflict) are readable only as <strong>regime products</strong> under Θ/Ω/Φ, not as timeless properties. The frame shifts from <strong>attribute-reading</strong> (“what something is”) to <strong>production-reading</strong> (“under which constraints it stabilizes”). Without this shift, Φ performs uncontrolled substitution, and the analysis drifts into ontological interpretation despite using structural notation.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>The costs concentrate asymmetrically along <strong>exposure and liability gradients</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role positions close to <strong>public exposure, institutional coupling, or durable records</strong> carry higher <strong>irreversibility costs</strong> when patterns are read as essence rather than regime.</li>
			<li>Role positions with <strong>lower exposure and higher exit latitude</strong> carry comparatively lower irreversibility costs and can treat the same configuration as reversible framing noise.</li>
			<li>Continuous load accumulates where Θ compresses option space: downstream coordination and reputational coupling become <strong>continuous costs</strong>, while endpoint-setting positions experience more <strong>decision-cost concentration</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under a young Α-field with elevated Θ-pressure and accelerated Φ-frequency, structurally rational response patterns cluster around <strong>hardening the interpretive regime</strong> rather than expanding substantive claims:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Aggregation and depersonalization</strong> become rational where exposure makes individual-near readings irreversibly expensive.</li>
			<li><strong>Historical constraint articulation</strong> becomes rational where it reduces Φ-substitution and preserves the difference between regime stabilization and essence attribution.</li>
			<li><strong>Formal narrowing of object claims</strong> becomes rational where broad claims increase misuse probability faster than Σ can consolidate coherence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are cost responses to exposure and irreversibility, not indicators of virtue, courage, or correctness.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not claim that any person or group “is” conflict-prone, nor that conflict is justified, excused, or condemned by history. It describes how, under Θ/Ω/Φ/Α conditions, interpretive drift toward essence-attribution becomes structurally likely unless Θ-history is made explicit as a constraint.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 13 — Enabling Conditions (Neutral, Non-Moral)</h3>
			<p>This chapter states enabling conditions under which conflict regimes become more frequent, more stable, and more legible as <strong>states</strong> rather than episodic events. These conditions are not moral diagnoses and not character claims. They describe how modern constraint fields reconfigure binding, exposure, recontextualization, and attractor formation such that <strong>stabilized incompatibility</strong> becomes a more common equilibrium.</p>
			<p>Across all four conditions, the common structural signature is a shift from <strong>Σ-carrying</strong> toward <strong>Φ-substitution</strong> under <strong>Θ-pressure</strong> and <strong>Ω-gradients</strong>, with <strong>Ψ</strong> becoming both more frequent and more revisable. Conflict does not “increase” because agents become worse; it stabilizes because the environment makes certain stabilization paths cheaper than integration.</p>
			<h4>13.1 Decoupling binding–survival (Θ/Ω) → Ψ partial/revisable; trust system-replaceable</h4>
			<p>When binding is no longer tightly coupled to survival constraints, <strong>Ψ can become partial</strong>: commitments can be entered, revised, and exited more frequently without immediate catastrophic loss. This does not reduce binding load; it changes its <strong>shape</strong>. Binding becomes more numerous, more localized, and more conditional.</p>
			<p>Under this regime, trust can be reallocated from person-near commitments to <strong>system-near substitutes</strong>: procedures, contracts, platforms, institutional scaffolds, and standardized reputational signals. The result is not “less trust,” but a recontextualized trust topology: <strong>Φ embeds commitments into systems</strong> while <strong>Σ-integration across persons and trajectories becomes less structurally necessary</strong> for continued operation.</p>
			<p>Conflict enabling effect: partial Ψ increases the number of co-existing trajectories that can remain incompatible without being forced into consolidation. The system continues to run while incompatibilities persist.</p>
			<h4>13.2 Externalization of risk and responsibility (Ω→anonymous) → load real but invisibly addressed; leadership delegitimized</h4>
			<p>Modern constraint fields often allow risk and responsibility to be carried while their assignment becomes less legible. <strong>Ω does not disappear</strong>; it becomes <strong>anonymous or distributed</strong> across interfaces, chains, and intermediate roles. Load remains real, but its routing is harder to identify and harder to contest inside a shared frame.</p>
			<p>Where load routing becomes opaque, “leadership” shifts from a role that can be evaluated by visible cost carriage to a role primarily visible via <strong>Φ-claims</strong> and procedural authority. This configuration does not require moral failure to produce delegitimation; it produces delegitimation structurally when <strong>cost proximity is misaligned with decision visibility</strong>.</p>
			<p>Conflict enabling effect: if costs are carried without legible endpoints, attempts at Σ-consolidation drift into narrative substitution, because the frame cannot represent the true cost topology directly. Conflict stabilizes as the most available ordering device when cost mapping is not jointly integrable.</p>
			<h4>13.3 Tech-accelerated group binding (Α_group) → permanent Φ; audience/externalization; groups replace trust</h4>
			<p>Accelerated communication and permanent archiving increase the probability that interactions become <strong>audience-coupled</strong>. Under audience coupling, recontextualization is not an occasional operation but a continuous one: <strong>Φ becomes ambient</strong>, repeatedly embedding scenes into new frames (feeds, clips, summaries, reputational markers, institutional artifacts).</p>
			<p>In such environments, binding often migrates from person-near trust to group-near stabilization: <strong>Α_group</strong> can form rapidly, stabilize quickly, and persist through recontextualization cycles. The group attractor supplies orientation, reduces uncertainty, and replaces the need for slow Σ-work across incompatible trajectories.</p>
			<p>Conflict enabling effect: once audience coupling is active, exits and repairs become more expensive (Θ and Ω amplify), and the cheapest stabilization path often becomes alignment with an attractor rather than integration with the opposing trajectory.</p>
			<h4>13.4 Narrative safety substitutes (Φ without Σ) → interpretation instead of carriage</h4>
			<p>Under pressure, systems often prefer interpretive operations to integrative operations. <strong>Φ is cheaper than Σ</strong> when consolidation would require cost carriage, reversibility constraints, or painful re-binding. Narrative safety substitutes are not “lies” in a moral sense; they are <strong>structural replacements</strong>: interpretive moves that permit continuation without resolving incompatibility.</p>
			<p>Typical signatures include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>frame inflation (expanding context until the specific incompatibility disappears as an object),</li>
			<li>historization (embedding present costs into a past-justification frame),</li>
			<li>motive reframing (changing the object from trajectory incompatibility to intent interpretation),</li>
			<li>procedural displacement (treating structural incompatibility as an administrative misunderstanding).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Conflict enabling effect: when Φ becomes the default, incompatibility is not integrated but continually re-described. This sustains the incompatibility while providing local coherence, allowing <strong>Α_conflict</strong> to stabilize without overt escalation.</p>
			<h4>13.5 Operator signature summary</h4>
			<p>A compact enabling-condition signature can be stated as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω</strong> routes exposure and load asymmetrically, often with reduced legibility.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ</strong> increases path dependence and raises exit costs over time.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ</strong> becomes continuous under audience coupling and institutional embedding.</li>
			<li><strong>Α</strong> stabilizes orientation (group or conflict attractors) when Σ-work is too expensive.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ</strong> becomes partial and revisable, increasing the number of co-existing incompatible bindings.</li>
			<li><strong>Σ</strong> is present as a normative ideal in discourse but absent as a consolidator in the actual constraint regime.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>13.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that modern conflict regimes are enabled when <strong>Φ becomes cheaper than Σ under Θ-pressure and Ω-gradients</strong>, while <strong>Ψ becomes partial and proliferative</strong>. The frame shifts from “integration as default” to “stabilization as default”: incompatibilities can persist as live states because system continuity no longer requires consolidation into a shared Σ-space. Conflict becomes a stable ordering device rather than an exception.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Costs distribute along exposure, legibility, and exit gradients:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role positions close to <strong>continuous exposure and follow-on load</strong> carry ongoing relational and operational costs that accumulate under Θ.</li>
			<li>Role positions closer to <strong>decision authority without direct cost proximity</strong> incur concentrated decision costs but can externalize follow-on costs into distributed routes.</li>
			<li>Irreversibility costs rise where audience coupling and archiving embed scenes into wider frames, making exit and repair asymmetrically expensive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under this cost topology, structurally rational response patterns include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Externalization and formalization</strong> where Σ-work becomes irreversibly expensive relative to system continuation.</li>
			<li><strong>Attractor alignment</strong> (group or conflict stabilization) where it reduces uncertainty and lowers local coordination cost under Θ-pressure.</li>
			<li><strong>Mediation termination</strong> where continuation produces compounding losses through asymmetric exit costs and audience coupling, and continued mediation only where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are cost responses under constraint, not indicators of moral quality or defect.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not claim that modern agents are worse, that groups are inherently illegitimate, or that narrative operations are “bad.” It describes enabling conditions under which Φ-substitution and attractor stabilization become structurally cheaper than Σ-integration under asymmetric cost distribution.</p>

			<h2>Part V — Extension Block: Leadership, Trust, Group Binding</h2>
			<h3>Chapter 14 — Sex-Relevant, Not Role-Free: Distributional Realism</h3>
			<p>This chapter introduces a constrained claim: certain conflict mechanics are <strong>sex-relevant</strong> in the sense that historical and institutional role distributions often correlate with sex-coded placement, visibility, and expected carriage. This is not an essence claim, not a trait claim, and not an ontological statement about “men” or “women.” The paper remains strictly structural: it describes how <strong>cost topology</strong> becomes legible only when roles are treated as real carriers of exposure, liability, and continuity.</p>
			<p>A recurrent misread in conflict discourse is the attempt to model conflict as if it occurred between “pure persons,” i.e., agents abstracted from structural placement. In PMS terms, this misread suppresses <strong>Ω</strong> (exposure gradients), flattens <strong>Θ</strong> (trajectory burden), and treats <strong>Ψ</strong> (binding) as symmetric by default. The result is predictable: costs become invisible, responsibility gradients become unnameable, and conflict is moralized because the structural map has been removed.</p>
			<h4>14.1 Distributional realism: roles are the carrier medium of conflict</h4>
			<p>Conflict is not primarily a clash of opinions. It is a stabilized incompatibility of practice trajectories under binding, time, and cost. Those constraints are not evenly distributed. They are carried by <strong>role positions</strong> inside frames (□): caregiving positions, authority positions, institutional positions, reputationally exposed positions, positions close to continuity work, and positions close to endpoint-setting.</p>
			<p>Distributional realism states:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω is not optional</strong>: exposure and capacity gradients are constitutive of conflict states.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ is not neutral</strong>: time does not “pass”; it compounds costs asymmetrically through continuity demands.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ is not merely private</strong>: binding loads can be imposed by roles, publicness, and obligations that persist independent of personal preference.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When roles are treated as real, conflict becomes legible as cost topology rather than as morality play. When roles are denied, conflict becomes legible only as narrative.</p>
			<h4>14.2 Sex-relevance as correlation with role placement, not causation</h4>
			<p>Sex relevance enters structurally via correlation within a given institutional field and historical window: if a society, institution, or subculture places sex-coded bodies into statistically stable role distributions, then the conflict mechanics of that field will show repeatable patterns of cost proximity and binding load that correlate with sex-coded placement. This is not “sex causes behavior.” It is “role distribution correlates with cost distribution.”</p>
			<p>The key move is to separate:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>placement</strong> (where role positions tend to be located),</li>
			<li><strong>exposure</strong> (what costs become unavoidable for those positions),</li>
			<li><strong>legibility</strong> (what can be publicly named without increasing exit cost).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sex relevance, in this restricted sense, is a visibility condition: it predicts which costs can be named as structural without triggering immediate moralization, because the audience often tries to re-personalize what is, in fact, a role topology.  </p>
			<p><strong>Misuse firewall:</strong> Nothing in this chapter licenses selection, exclusion, ranking, or legitimacy claims about persons or groups. Sex relevance here is only a descriptive visibility condition for role-distributed cost topology.  </p>
			<h4>14.3 Why “pure persons” makes the mechanics invisible</h4>
			<p>Treating agents as role-free produces three systematic distortions:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><p><strong>Pseudo-symmetry of costs</strong>
			If role topology is removed, cost distribution is inferred from surface behavior. This encourages symmetry narratives (“both are equally responsible”) even when exposure gradients are structurally asymmetric.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ψ is misread as preference</strong>
			Binding loads are treated as voluntary attachment (“just leave,” “just stop caring”), which collapses the structural meaning of binding into motivational speculation.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Φ replaces Σ under interpretive pressure</strong>
			Because real costs cannot be represented, discourse shifts to motive frames, intent frames, and moral frames. Φ-substitution becomes the dominant stabilization path: interpretation replaces carriage.</p>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Distributional realism therefore functions as an anti-moralization constraint. It does not add a new moral story; it restores the structural map in which cost patterns can be described without person-typing.</p>
			<p><strong>Docking:</strong> compatible with EDEN/SEX cross-anchor (sex relevance treated as role-distribution visibility under Ω/Θ/Ψ/□, not as essence or causation).</p>
			<h4>14.4 Minimal operator signature</h4>
			<p>A minimal signature for sex-relevant distributional realism is:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>□</strong>: role-space is real and constraining.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω</strong>: exposure gradients are not symmetric and not eliminable by rhetoric.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ</strong>: continuity work compounds costs; options shrink asymmetrically.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ</strong>: binding loads attach to positions and obligations, not only to inner preference.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This signature does not predict outcomes. It predicts where legibility and misread risks concentrate when conflict states emerge.</p>
			<h4>14.5 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that conflict mechanics become systematically illegible when role topology is denied. Sex relevance, where present, is a <strong>correlational visibility effect</strong>: stable placement into carriage and binding positions modifies Ω/Θ/Ψ load patterns without implying essence or causation. The frame shifts from “persons in disagreement” to “roles carrying asymmetric exposure and continuity under binding.”</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Costs distribute by role proximity:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role positions close to <strong>continuity and relational load</strong> carry continuous costs that compound under Θ and become expensive to exit under Ψ.</li>
			<li>Role positions close to <strong>endpoint setting and procedural authority</strong> carry decision and liability costs that concentrate at specific points, often with lower continuous exposure.</li>
			<li>Role positions that are <strong>publicly legible as carriers</strong> accrue additional exit and reputation costs when scenes are audience-coupled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric distribution, structurally rational patterns include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>externalization into systems</strong> where direct Σ-consolidation would become irreversibly expensive under Θ-compounding;</li>
			<li><strong>withdrawal or formalization</strong> where continued exposure would impose continuous costs without a viable consolidation path;</li>
			<li><strong>stabilization via narrative or group attractors</strong> where interpretive closure is cheaper than cost carriage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are structural responses under cost pressure, not defects, virtues, or prescriptions.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not claim that sex determines conflict behavior, that any group is responsible, or that any role placement is morally justified. It describes how Ω/Θ/Ψ cost topology can correlate with sex-coded role distributions and how denying roles produces pseudo-symmetry and cost displacement.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 15 — Non-Symmetrizability: Conflicts with Infrastructure, Risk, and Time Load</h3>
			<p>This chapter fixes a structural limit: some conflicts cannot be symmetrized, not because participants “refuse fairness,” but because the configuration contains non-transferable loads. In these cases, symmetry is not a moral goal that could be achieved by better communication. It is a structural impossibility produced by exposure gradients, continuity constraints, and binding.</p>
			<p>Here, “infrastructure” names any background system that must keep running: logistics, care, coordination, institutional continuity, operational reliability, reputational stability, or procedural throughput. “Risk load” names asymmetric proximity to irreversible loss. “Time load” names Θ-driven compounding: the fact that delay changes the option space.</p>
			<p>When conflict is coupled to these loads, attempts to symmetrize typically produce pseudo-symmetry: the narrative image of equal burden without equal cost proximity.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Ω, Θ, Ψ, Σ.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to leadership fixpoint (structural viability under asymmetric carriage).</p>
			<h4>15.1 The symmetry production error</h4>
			<p>In non-symmetrizability regimes, symmetry is often demanded at the level of discourse (equal blame, equal concession, equal emotional weight), while the actual costs are distributed by role proximity to infrastructure and risk.</p>
			<p>A symmetry production attempt typically takes one of two forms:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>discursive symmetry:</strong> equalized narratives and equalized responsibility language without changing the underlying Ω/Θ topology;</li>
			<li><strong>procedural symmetry:</strong> identical rules applied to positions with non-identical exposure, producing formally equal treatment with structurally unequal cost.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Neither produces structural symmetry. Both can increase Σ-friction because they force integration attempts to operate on a distorted cost map.</p>
			<h4>15.2 Infrastructure-coupled conflict: carriage is not optional</h4>
			<p>Where infrastructure must continue, some role positions cannot stop carrying continuity load without immediate downstream collapse. This creates a constraint: exit and interruption (Χ) may exist in principle, but are not practically affordable for the positions adjacent to continuity obligations.</p>
			<p>This is not an account of virtue or sacrifice. It is a description of load-bearing geometry:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Some positions are adjacent to <strong>continuous load</strong> (Θ-coupled operation).</li>
			<li>Other positions are adjacent to <strong>episodic decision points</strong> (endpoint-setting).</li>
			<li>The conflict state persists because the system continues to demand throughput while Σ-consolidation is blocked.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The resulting conflict pattern can be stable, not escalating, because the attractor is the infrastructure itself: the system keeps running and therefore keeps coupling trajectories.</p>
			<h4>15.3 Risk proximity and irreversibility: why “equal stakes” is often false</h4>
			<p>Non-symmetrizability also arises when one role position is closer to irreversible loss: liability, exposure, safety, long-term consequences, or publicness. In such cases, the configuration contains an Ω-gradient that cannot be removed by agreement language.</p>
			<p>A practical marker is <strong>irreversibility mismatch</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>One position faces terminal or near-terminal loss if the conflict trajectory continues.</li>
			<li>Another position faces relational, reputational, or reversible losses that remain compensable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When irreversibility mismatch exists, “equal compromise” often becomes structurally unviable, because equal concessions do not map to equal costs.</p>
			<h4>15.4 Θ-load: shrinking option space makes symmetry late</h4>
			<p>Θ-load produces path dependence: delay does not merely postpone resolution; it changes what is possible. Symmetry attempts that arrive late often operate on a narrower option set than the one assumed by participants earlier in the trajectory.</p>
			<p>A key property is asynchronous time-positioning:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Different role positions can inhabit different “frame-time points” at once: one position has already internalized sunk costs and closure constraints; another position still treats the scene as reversible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a psychological claim. It is a trajectory constraint: the cost of reversal is not synchronized.</p>
			<h4>15.5 What replaces “solving” under non-symmetrizability</h4>
			<p>In non-symmetrizability regimes, the relevant structural fork is not “solve vs fail,” but:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>carriage viability:</strong> whether the configuration can make continued load-bearing structurally viable without collapsing D (dignity-in-practice) under Θ/Ω pressure; or</li>
			<li><strong>tragedy fixation:</strong> whether the configuration can stabilize the non-integrable remainder without pretending Σ has been achieved.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>“Fixation” here means containment: a stable boundary around incompatibility that prevents unbounded cost displacement. It is not moral reconciliation and not a promise of integration.</p>
			<h4>15.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that symmetry cannot be produced in conflicts coupled to infrastructure continuity, irreversible risk proximity, and Θ-driven option shrinkage. Σ-attempts that presuppose symmetric stakes drift into pseudo-symmetry: integration language without an integrable cost map. The frame shifts from “negotiable disagreement” to “non-transferable load topology under binding and time.”</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Costs distribute by proximity to load-bearing constraints:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role positions adjacent to <strong>continuity and infrastructure load</strong> carry continuous costs that compound under Θ and become expensive to suspend under Ψ.</li>
			<li>Role positions adjacent to <strong>endpoint setting and liability concentration</strong> carry terminal or punctuated costs tied to irreversible exposure.</li>
			<li>Role positions with <strong>lower risk proximity</strong> can sustain longer deliberation without terminal loss, while role positions near irreversibility face rapidly rising exit and delay costs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric and non-transferable load distribution, structurally rational patterns include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>discontinuing symmetry production attempts where they increase cost displacement and make Σ irreversibly expensive;</li>
			<li>formalizing boundaries and responsibilities where infrastructure must continue and option space is shrinking;</li>
			<li>stabilizing a tragedy remainder (non-integrable residue) where consolidation would require costs that exceed structural affordability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are cost-constrained consequences under Ω/Θ/Ψ pressure, not judgments about maturity, goodwill, or competence.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not claim that anyone “should carry” or that asymmetry is morally justified. It does not prescribe interventions or assign blame. It describes structural limits on symmetrization when conflicts are coupled to infrastructure continuity, irreversible risk proximity, and Θ-driven path dependence.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 16 — Asymmetric Leadership as Conflict Fixpoint (Integration Substitute)</h3>
			<p>When conflict is stabilized incompatibility, the structural question is not “who is right,” but what mechanism prevents the incompatibility from converting into unbounded cost displacement. Chapter 15 established that symmetry cannot be produced in infrastructure/risk/time-coupled regimes. This chapter specifies the complementary structural node: leadership as a fixpoint that substitutes for shared integration where shared Σ is impossible.</p>
			<p>In this paper, “leadership” is not a trait, a moral privilege, or a domination claim. It is a structural position that absorbs consolidation work when the system cannot produce a shared integration spine. Leadership appears when the configuration requires a stable output despite Σ₁≠Σ₂, and when binding and temporal coupling make indefinite oscillation structurally expensive.</p>
			<h4>16.1 The fixpoint condition</h4>
			<p>A minimal signature for leadership emergence in conflict can be stated as:</p>
			<p><strong>Σ₁ ≠ Σ₂ + Ψ + Θ + Ω → Fixpoint requirement</strong></p>
			<p>Meaning:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Σ₁ ≠ Σ₂:</strong> there is no jointly consolidatable coherence object available. This is not a “misunderstanding” in Φ terms; it is an integration incompatibility.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ:</strong> commitments, obligations, identity load, or institutional binding prevent free exit and prevent “ignore and move on” solutions.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ:</strong> trajectories persist and option space shrinks; delay is not neutral.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω:</strong> exposure and liability are not symmetric; costs concentrate by role proximity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Under these conditions, the system still demands continuity: decisions must be made, coordination must hold, or downstream obligations must be met. If shared Σ cannot be produced, a fixpoint must carry the consolidation function.</p>
			<h4>16.2 What leadership does structurally</h4>
			<p>Leadership, in this grammar, is the structural operation that produces a stable trajectory output when integration is unavailable.</p>
			<p>It performs three functions:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Output stabilization:</strong> selects or enacts a trajectory branch that allows the system to continue under Θ despite Σ incompatibility.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost localization:</strong> prevents unbounded cost diffusion by making costs legible and containable in a bounded region of the configuration.</li>
			<li><strong>Binding maintenance:</strong> keeps Ψ from dissolving into uncontrolled exit, retaliatory accounting, or attractor-stabilized drift.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is not “solving the conflict.” It is preventing the conflict state from converting into a regime where every interaction becomes evidence, every non-event becomes load-bearing, and every frame shift becomes an escalation proxy. The fixpoint may be carried by a person, a role procedure, or an institutional mechanism; it is defined by function, not by bearer.</p>
			<p><strong>Validity constraint:</strong> In PMS terms, the fixpoint remains a valid stabilization only if it preserves distance (Χ), maintains reversibility where structurally possible, and does not collapse dignity-in-practice (D) into coercion. A “fixpoint” that suspends these constraints is not leadership in this grammar; it is governance drift (structurally illegible as PMS application).</p>
			<h4>16.3 Why leadership is asymmetric by necessity</h4>
			<p>If the system could produce symmetry, it would not require a fixpoint. The fixpoint exists because the configuration is already asymmetric in exposure, liability, or continuity load. Leadership therefore inherits asymmetry rather than creating it.</p>
			<p>A symmetric “leadership” concept is typically a pseudo-symmetry attempt: it assumes equal cost proximity while demanding equal consolidation responsibility. Under Ω/Θ pressure, this converts into one of two outcomes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>consolidation is silently performed by the role position closest to continuity load (unacknowledged leadership), or</li>
			<li>consolidation is replaced by Φ-substitution and Α-stabilization (narrative management and drift instead of viable output).</li>

			<h4>16.4 Distinguishing leadership from domination in this model</h4>
			<p>Domination is an interpretive overlay that presupposes psychological intent or moral status. PMS-CONFLICT does not require that overlay.</p>
			<p>In this model:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Leadership</strong> is defined by <strong>function under constraint</strong> (output stabilization under Σ incompatibility and Θ coupling).</li>
			<li><strong>Domination</strong> is a moralized reading that may or may not be applied externally, but is not needed to describe the structural mechanism.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Leadership can be present in configurations where no agent seeks control, and it can be absent in configurations where agents seek control. The operator signature is the differentiator, not the narrative.</p>
			<p>Domination may be a valid downstream evaluation in other frameworks; PMS-CONFLICT does not require it to model the mechanism.</p>
			<h4>16.5 Failure modes of the fixpoint</h4>
			<p>When the fixpoint cannot be established or cannot be sustained, the conflict state typically drifts into one of the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Α_conflict hardening:</strong> stable orbit through role fixation and evidence capture, with Σ-work avoided and replaced by predictability.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ inflation:</strong> recontextualization becomes the primary currency, replacing consolidation with interpretation and license conversion.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ fracture:</strong> binding becomes unstable; commitments are reinterpreted as optional, or exit becomes the dominant move where exit costs can be externalized.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are not defects. They are structurally rational drift outcomes when a viable stabilization node is absent under Θ/Ω load.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Σ, Ψ, Θ, Ω.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to trust (how stabilization is accepted, contested, or externalized).</p>
			<h4>16.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that when Σ₁≠Σ₂ under non-trivial Ψ and Θ coupling, a fixpoint function is required to stabilize output. “Leadership” names the structural substitution for shared Σ: a stabilization node that carries consolidation function without producing integration. The frame shifts from “integration is attainable through critique” to “continuity requires a fixpoint under asymmetric constraint.”</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs distribute by proximity to consolidation responsibility and exit affordability. Role positions adjacent to continuity and downstream obligation carry continuous load and accrue follow-on costs under Θ if stabilization is absent. Role positions adjacent to endpoint-setting and liability proximity carry terminal or punctuated costs when branch selection concentrates exposure. Role positions with lower exit costs can externalize stabilization failure into withdrawal or drift, while role positions with higher exit costs absorb compounding coordination costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution with Σ incompatibility and Θ pressure, structurally rational responses include establishing an explicit stabilization node (formalized or de facto) where continued oscillation becomes irreversibly expensive; contesting or relocating the fixpoint where its cost localization would generate higher downstream costs than drift; and allowing drift into Α/Φ regimes where stabilization cannot be afforded or cannot be legitimized within the constraint field. These are consequences of cost topology under Ω/Θ/Ψ, not evaluations of intent, competence, or virtue.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not state that anyone should lead, submit, or carry. It does not equate leadership with moral superiority or domination, and it does not prescribe governance. It describes a structural fixpoint requirement that emerges when shared integration is impossible under binding and temporality, and how costs distribute when that requirement is met or not met.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 17 — Trust Is Derivative (Not Prerequisite)</h3>
			<p>This chapter blocks a recurring interpretive error: treating trust as the precondition that must exist before conflict can be handled. In PMS-CONFLICT, trust is not a prerequisite operator. It is a derived structural effect that appears when stabilization, binding, and feedback constraints make continued coupling less expensive than withdrawal or drift.</p>
			<p>Trust becomes legible only after a configuration has already achieved a specific constraint regime: a bounded stabilization node (often the Chapter 16 fixpoint function), coupled to interruption capacity (Χ), temporality management (Θ), and asymmetry visibility (Ω) under binding (Ψ). Without that regime, “trust talk” tends to function as Φ: a narrative substitute for missing constraint architecture.</p>
			<h4>17.1 Trust as a structural effect</h4>
			<p>In this model, trust is not a psychological state and not a moral reward. It is an emergent property of a configuration that meets three conditions:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Bounded stabilization:</strong> the fixpoint function is constrained (limited scope, explicit edges, non-total reach into every frame).</li>
			<li><strong>Feedback coupling:</strong> stabilization is coupled to correction signals that can interrupt or revise trajectories without making exit irreversibly expensive.</li>
			<li><strong>Cost legibility under asymmetry:</strong> exposure gradients are visible enough that cost displacement does not masquerade as symmetry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Under these conditions, sustained coordination becomes structurally rational: uncertainty is priced, reversibility is maintained where possible, and binding can persist without requiring permanent Φ-substitution.</p>
			<h4>17.2 Why “trust first” fails structurally</h4>
			<p>“Trust first” reads as a precondition claim, but structurally it often appears as a masking maneuver when the system lacks bounded stabilization.</p>
			<p>If binding is weak or externally replaceable, the configuration tends to route through substitutes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Group insurance:</strong> binding is relocated into group attractors (Α_group) that provide identity stability and cost diffusion without requiring shared Σ.</li>
			<li><strong>Narrative coercion:</strong> Φ expands to create legitimacy, alignment, or permission structures that replace consolidation with interpretation.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ inflation:</strong> every failure to integrate is converted into story-work, motive-work, or historization rather than constraint repair.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These regimes can produce surface compliance and short-term coordination, but they do not produce trust in the structural sense defined here. They produce stability via substitution, not via bounded, feedback-coupled stabilization.  </p>
			<p>Any institutional evaluation of stabilization legitimacy belongs downstream (e.g., via IA-box criteria), not inside the descriptive trust grammar.  </p>
			<p><strong>Firewall:</strong> “Trust” must not be demanded as a legitimacy weapon; where bounded stabilization and feedback are absent, “trust demands” are structurally indistinguishable from Φ-driven coercion. </p>
			<h4>17.3 Bounded Χ as the trust hinge</h4>
			<p>Trust requires Χ to remain operational as a constraint, not as a virtue claim:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ must be available enough</strong> that interruption can change the state (reset, revise, detach from attractor capture).</li>
			<li><strong>Χ must be bounded enough</strong> that it does not dissolve binding (permanent exit posture) or become a unilateral privilege (asymmetric immunity from consequences).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Trust appears when Χ is neither absent nor unlimited: when interruptibility is feasible without converting every interruption into an escalation vector or a liability dump.</p>
			<h4>17.4 Drift outcomes when trust cannot emerge</h4>
			<p>When the configuration cannot sustain bounded stabilization and feedback coupling, the system typically drifts into one of the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Α-driven predictability:</strong> conflict stabilizes because predictability becomes cheaper than integration work.</li>
			<li><strong>Φ-driven legitimacy cycles:</strong> legitimacy is produced through recontextualization rather than through consolidation.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ weakening or relocation:</strong> binding is reduced, outsourced, or shifted into publicness, group alignment, or institutional substitution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are not failures of will. They are structurally rational outcomes under cost topology when trust conditions are absent.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Χ (bounded/limited), Θ, Ω, Ψ, Φ.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to groups (how trust substitutes are produced and stabilized).</p>
			<h4>17.5 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that trust is not a prerequisite input but a derivative effect of a bounded stabilization regime: stabilization must be limited in scope and coupled to interruption-capable feedback (Χ) under temporality (Θ) and asymmetry (Ω) with non-trivial binding (Ψ). Where these constraints are absent, “trust” shifts from an emergent coordination property to Φ-substitution and attractor-stabilized drift.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Costs concentrate by proximity to continuity and exposure:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs carry <strong>continuous load</strong> when trust cannot emerge; they pay follow-on costs under Θ through ongoing uncertainty management.</li>
			<li>Role positions closer to endpoint and liability costs experience <strong>terminal costs</strong> when stabilization fails and the system requires abrupt branch selection or externalization.</li>
			<li>Role positions with lower exit costs can route into withdrawal, group insurance, or narrative substitution, while role positions with higher exit costs absorb the residual coordination burden.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, structurally rational responses include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>maintaining bounded stabilization with feedback coupling where uncontrolled drift would generate higher downstream costs;</li>
			<li>relocating binding into groups or institutions where individualized stabilization is structurally unaffordable;</li>
			<li>expanding Φ as a substitute when Σ consolidation and bounded Χ cannot be sustained without becoming irreversibly expensive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are cost consequences under Ω/Θ/Ψ/Χ constraints, not judgements about maturity or intent.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not state that anyone should “trust more,” lead, comply, or remain bound. It does not moralize distrust. It describes the structural conditions under which trust can emerge as a derivative coordination effect and the predictable substitution patterns (group insurance, Φ inflation, attractor stabilization) that appear when those conditions are not met.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 18 — Groups as Stabilizers (No Enemy Model)</h3>
			<p>This chapter describes groups as a structural stabilizer under conflict conditions, not as an enemy class, pathology, or moral failure. “Group” here denotes a binding and coordination substrate that can absorb exposure, distribute load, and produce legibility when bilateral or role-local integration becomes structurally unaffordable.</p>
			<p>In PMS-CONFLICT, group formation is treated as a technology of stabilization: a way to make trajectories survivable under asymmetric exposure (Ω), binding load (Ψ), and interpretive pressure (Φ). The model does not assume malign intent. It models cost-relief mechanics.</p>
			<h4>18.1 Why groups stabilize</h4>
			<p>Groups stabilize conflict by providing four functions that are expensive to produce in dyadic or role-local coupling once Σ-bridging becomes unreliable:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Diffusion:</strong> costs and liabilities are spread across multiple role positions, reducing terminal exposure at any single point.</li>
			<li><strong>Judgment delegation:</strong> evaluative burden is outsourced; local actors no longer need to generate legitimacy alone.</li>
			<li><strong>Narrative safety:</strong> Φ can operate with less friction, because the group supplies an audience, a memory, and a coherence scaffold that substitutes for Σ.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ relief:</strong> binding becomes collective rather than personal; identity load is carried by membership and alignment rather than by self-binding to integrated trajectories.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These functions are structurally attractive when exit is costly, integration is non-viable, and trajectories are already coupled.</p>
			<h4>18.2 Tech as permanence: the availability shift</h4>
			<p>Under modern conditions, groups are not episodic. They are continuously available. That changes the attractor landscape:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Low-friction recruitment:</strong> alignment can be obtained quickly, converting uncertainty into belonging.</li>
			<li><strong>Persistent audience:</strong> every local episode can be recontextualized into a durable public or semi-public frame.</li>
			<li><strong>Memory externalization:</strong> records, screenshots, feeds, and archives make Φ-stabilization easier than Σ consolidation.</li>
			<li><strong>Always-on comparison:</strong> pseudo-symmetry becomes cheap: integration is replaced by comparative narratives and quantified signals.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This does not require a conspiracy model. It is a structural availability effect: when group support is always reachable, individual stabilization incentives shift.</p>
			<h4>18.3 Replacement chain under pressure</h4>
			<p>When trust cannot emerge as a derived effect (Chapter 17), group binding tends to replace the missing constraint regime via a repeatable chain:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>trust (as emergent coordination effect) is bypassed;</li>
			<li><strong>consensus signals</strong> become a surrogate for integration;</li>
			<li><strong>responsibility diffuses</strong> because costs are no longer localized to a bounded stabilization node;</li>
			<li>fixation increases because the group provides a stable Φ/Α substrate even when Σ remains unavailable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this chain, group membership functions as a stabilization substitute: it supplies closure, coherence, and legitimacy without requiring integrability of trajectories.</p>
			<h4>18.4 Non-demonizing boundary: when group stabilization is rational</h4>
			<p>Group stabilization is structurally rational under at least three conditions:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>high Ω exposure</strong> where individual role positions cannot carry terminal liability alone;</li>
			<li><strong>high Θ pressure</strong> where delays collapse option space faster than local integration work can operate;</li>
			<li><strong>high Φ pressure</strong> where meaning-making demand exceeds available Σ consolidation bandwidth.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these cases, the group is not an ethical mistake. It is a cost solution under constraint.</p>
			<p>Any application that uses this description to justify targeting, shaming, or coercing group members violates PMS entry conditions (Χ, reversibility, D) and is formally invalid as PMS.  </p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Α_group, Φ, Ψ, Ω.  </p>
			<p><strong>Docking:</strong> to narrative dominance and EDEN parasitics (how group-stabilized Φ/Α regimes become the primary legibility layer).  </p>
			<p><strong>Firewall:</strong> This chapter does not authorize de-legitimizing groups as such. “Group stabilization” is not a moral accusation and not an epistemic discrediting device. The model names a stabilization mechanism, not an illegitimate actor class.</p>
			<h3>18.5 Chapter Closure</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that group binding functions as a stabilization substitute when trust-as-derivative cannot be produced: Φ and Α_group provide coherence and predictability where Σ consolidation is non-viable, while Ψ load is shifted from self-binding to membership binding under Ω-shaped exposure gradients.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h4>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs distribute by exposure, exit affordability, and the degree of trajectory coupling. Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs tend to use groups to reduce terminal exposure through diffusion and delegated judgment. Role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs tend to use groups to reduce continuous load by externalizing coherence production into narrative and alignment scaffolds. Role positions with lower exit costs can switch groups or frames with minimal penalty, while role positions with higher exit costs remain trajectory-coupled and absorb follow-on costs created by group-level stabilization (publicness, persistence, archival memory).</p>
			<h4>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h4>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, group stabilization is structurally rational where individual stabilization becomes irreversibly expensive and where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs. In such regimes, diffusion, judgment delegation, and narrative safety appear as cost-minimizing consequences, while responsibility diffusion and fixation emerge as predictable follow-on effects of Α_group coupled with Φ substitution.</p>
			<h4>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h4>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not frame groups as enemies, pathologies, or moral defects, and it does not prescribe joining or avoiding groups. It describes structural stabilization patterns under asymmetric cost conditions and continuous availability, including how diffusion, delegated judgment, and narrative safety can replace Σ consolidation without implying moral evaluation or intent attribution.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 19 — Emotional Coercion as Structural Coupling (Ψ + Recognition ↔ Denial)</h3>
			<p>This chapter formalizes “emotional coercion” as a coupling pattern inside conflict regimes, not as a diagnosis, trait attribution, or a theory of motives. The term is retained only as a reader-facing label for a structural object: a configuration in which binding and recognition become coupled to denial dynamics, producing constraint effects through non-response, withdrawal, and the delegitimization of distance.</p>
			<h4>19.1 Definition (structural, non-psychological)</h4>
			<p><strong>Emotional coercion</strong> denotes a <strong>coupling of binding (Ψ) and recognition conditions</strong> such that the maintenance of the relation, role-access, or interaction channel becomes contingent on accepting a denial structure.</p>
			<p>Minimal form:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>a recognition demand is made load-bearing (explicitly or implicitly);</li>
			<li>the recognition demand is coupled to a denial constraint (what may not be named, framed, or counted);</li>
			<li>refusal does not merely disagree; it triggers structural penalties via exit-cost inflation or channel control.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The object is not “emotion.” The object is <strong>constraint coupling</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Terminology firewall:</strong> “Coercion” here names a constraint effect (control relevance of Λ under Ψ), not a character verdict. It must not be used as a label for persons or as a justification for retaliation, exposure, or enforcement.</p>
			<h4>19.2 Recognition under denial: the coupling mechanism</h4>
			<p>Conflict regimes often contain recognition requests: acknowledgment of effort, harm, asymmetry, contribution, exposure, or standing. In a non-coercive configuration, recognition claims remain negotiable within a shared frame (□), and distance (Χ) remains available as a stabilizing resource.</p>
			<p>In the coercive coupling configuration, recognition is treated as a gate condition while the relevant structure is denied:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ψ is active:</strong> the relationship, role, or channel is non-trivially binding.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω is present but obscured:</strong> exposure or liability gradients exist, but are not allowed to be framed as gradients.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ is delegitimized:</strong> reflective distance is reframed as disloyalty, coldness, avoidance, or illegitimate meta-position.</li>
			<li><strong>Λ becomes control-relevant:</strong> non-response, withdrawal, or delay becomes the penalty mechanism that enforces the coupling.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This produces a stable constraint: recognition is demanded, but the structural terms under which recognition would be legible are blocked.</p>
			<p>“Denial” is <strong>used strictly</strong> as a frame constraint (□): a restriction on what counts as admissible description in the scene, <em>not</em> a claim about anyone’s psychology.</p>
			<h4>19.3 Canonical signature: Ψ + Ω obscured + Χ delegitimized → Λ control</h4>
			<p>A canonical recognition–denial coupling signature can be written as:</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ + (Ω obscured) + (Χ delegitimized) → Λ_control</strong></p>
			<p>Where:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ψ</strong> supplies binding leverage (continued access matters).</li>
			<li><strong>Ω obscured</strong> removes the language of asymmetric exposure and converts it into a symmetry narrative.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ delegitimized</strong> prevents reflective interruption and meta-positioning, making local response the only permitted mode.</li>
			<li><strong>Λ_control</strong> operationalizes enforcement via silence, withdrawal, delayed response, or channel scarcity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The signature is descriptive. It specifies how a non-event becomes load-bearing under binding and obscured asymmetry.</p>
			<h4>19.4 Why Λ control is effective under binding</h4>
			<p>Λ (non-event) becomes coercive only when it is structurally consequential:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>the interaction channel is scarce or privileged (access is not freely replaceable);</li>
			<li>exit is costly (social, reputational, institutional, or identity-bound);</li>
			<li>temporality (Θ) amplifies delay into option collapse (deadlines, escalating downstream effects, accumulating uncertainty).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this regime, “non-response” is not a lack of action. It is an action-equivalent move that redistributes costs and forces trajectory coupling.</p>
			<h4>19.5 Depersonalization rule: coupling without character claims</h4>
			<p>This model does not require that any role position intends coercion, understands the coupling, or experiences itself as exercising leverage. The structure can be produced by institutional design, scarcity of channels, publicness, or prior stabilization of attractors.</p>
			<p>The analytic object is the <strong>coupling of operators</strong>, not the inner life of actors.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Λ, Ψ, Ω, Χ.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> to institutionalized Χ (how distance becomes regulated, priced, or delegitimized by environment and role structure).</p>
			<h4>19.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that recognition demands can become coercive when they are coupled to denial of the relevant asymmetry and when reflective distance is delegitimized, making Λ (non-event) function as a control operator under binding rather than as incidental absence.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Costs distribute by channel control, exit affordability, and Θ-amplified delay. Role positions controlling channel availability or timing can externalize costs into Λ by withholding response, shifting continuous load onto role positions exposed to uncertainty, continuity obligations, or downstream deadlines. Role positions with higher exit costs (identity load, institutional coupling, reputational exposure) absorb follow-on costs from delay and withdrawal, while role positions with lower exit costs can impose or tolerate Λ without comparable penalty. Irreversible costs concentrate where Θ-amplified delay collapses option space, while relational costs concentrate where recognition becomes a gate condition and denied framing prevents Σ consolidation.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, Λ control is terminated where it becomes irreversibly expensive to maintain uncertainty and continued where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs than compliance with the recognition–denial coupling. In such regimes, externalization, formalization, and withdrawal appear as structural consequences of priced or delegitimized Χ, not as defects, and Σ work is predictably displaced into Φ or attractor stabilization when denied framing blocks integrability.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not diagnose individuals, attribute motives, or imply that any role position is morally inferior. It does not prescribe intervention. It describes a structural coupling pattern in which Ψ, obscured Ω, delegitimized Χ, and Λ control interact to produce predictable constraint effects under asymmetric cost conditions.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 20 — Why “Keeping the Wheel” Is Insufficient: Institutionalized Χ</h3>
			<p>This chapter isolates a recurrent category error: treating leadership as a purely personal stabilizer (“someone keeps the wheel”) while leaving distance (Χ) non-institutional, optional, or privately enforced. In PMS-CONFLICT terms, this is a stability failure. Leadership can temporarily guide asymmetry (Ω) and carry binding (Ψ), but without institutionalized distance, the configuration predictably collapses into substitution dynamics: group insurance, narrative coercion, and conflict attractor stabilization.</p>
			<p>“Institutionalized Χ” denotes a structural condition in which reflective distance is not merely an individual capacity but a <strong>role-external constraint regime</strong>: mandated boundaries, interruptibility rights, adjudication criteria, and feedback coupling. It is not a moral claim. It is a mechanical condition for preventing cost displacement under asymmetry and time pressure.</p>
			<h4>20.1 The insufficiency of personal steering</h4>
			<p>“Keeping the wheel” is a local description: a role position remains decision-capable under load, continues carriage, and prevents immediate fragmentation. This may delay visible breakdown, but it does not produce a stable regime when:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>exit costs are asymmetric and rising (Ω + Θ),</li>
			<li>binding is non-trivial and identity-adjacent (Ψ),</li>
			<li>recontextualization pressure is high (Φ inflation),</li>
			<li>conflict attractors are available (Α_conflict),</li>
			<li>distance is treated as discretionary rather than enforced (Χ non-institutional).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In such configurations, the leader role becomes a sink for unpriced costs. The system appears “held together” while its constraint structure is drifting toward unviability.</p>
			<h4>20.2 Institutionalized Χ: what it is structurally</h4>
			<p>Institutionalized Χ is a publicly legible, role-independent distance regime. The list below is a recognition grammar for what “Χ is institutionalized” minimally means in a configuration; it is not a blueprint, a recommendation, or a universal design.</p>
			<p>Minimal components:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Mandate:</strong> who may interrupt, pause, or reframe; under what conditions.</li>
			<li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> what is out of scope, what is non-negotiable, what cannot be demanded as recognition collateral.</li>
			<li><strong>Criteria:</strong> what counts as a decision, a revision, a failure, and a resolved inconsistency at the level of Σ.</li>
			<li><strong>Feedback coupling:</strong> routes by which errors, overload, and drift are detected and corrected without requiring personal confrontation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These components do not solve conflict. They stabilize the space in which conflict can remain readable without collapsing into coercive coupling or narrative substitution. They are stated as minimal legibility conditions, not as a recommended design; instantiation is domain-specific and remains reversible under PMS entry conditions.</p>
			<h4>20.3 Why leadership collapses without institutionalized Χ</h4>
			<p>When Χ is not institutionalized, distance becomes a contested resource. The predictable effects:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Χ is priced by conflict:</strong> interruptibility is treated as defection, coldness, or illegitimate meta-position.</li>
			<li><strong>Σ-work becomes personally owned:</strong> consolidation attempts are attributed to role positions rather than treated as structural necessity.</li>
			<li><strong>Ω becomes politically opaque:</strong> asymmetry is denied at the same time it governs cost distribution, producing pseudo-symmetry narratives.</li>
			<li><strong>Λ becomes a control channel:</strong> non-response, delay, and procedural scarcity become leverage because there is no shared distance regime that can neutralize them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a psychological story. It is a regime transition: the system substitutes personal steering for structural distance and then converts that steering into a contested liability node.</p>
			<p>Where institutionalization of Χ is pursued by humiliation, exposure, or coercive enforcement, the application violates dignity-in-practice (D) and is <strong>formally invalid</strong> as PMS.  </p>
			<h4>20.4 The minimal formulas (recognition grammar)</h4>
			<p>The chapter uses two formulas as recognition grammar for stable vs unstable leadership regimes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Ω guided + Χ institutional + Θ explicit → trust possible</strong></p>
			<p>Meaning: asymmetry is acknowledged and guided (Ω), distance is enforced as a shared regime (Χ), and time/trajectory constraints are explicit (Θ). Under these conditions, trust can emerge as a derivative effect rather than as a premise.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Ω guided − Χ → groups/narratives/Α_conflict</strong></p>
			<p>Meaning: even if asymmetry is guided, the absence of institutionalized distance causes the system to seek substitutes: group stabilization (Α_group), narrative coercion (Φ inflation), and conflict stabilization (Α_conflict). This is a mechanical drift path, not a condemnation.</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>20.5 Stability condition, not resolution promise</h4>
			<p>Institutionalized Χ does not remove tragedy, does not guarantee integration, and does not prevent all conflict. It prevents a specific collapse: the conversion of distance into a contested moral token and the subsequent displacement of costs into non-events, narratives, and group insurance mechanisms.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Χ, Ω, Θ, Ψ, Α_conflict (Φ as typical substitution carrier).<br><strong>Docking:</strong> to Part VI (docking) and Part VII (governance overlay).  </p>
			<h4>20.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that leadership without institutionalized distance (Χ) cannot stabilize conflict regimes under asymmetry (Ω) and temporality (Θ): personal steering substitutes for a missing constraint regime and therefore converts consolidation work into a contested liability, accelerating Φ-substitution and attractor stabilization (Α_conflict).</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>Role positions tasked with steering absorb continuous load when Χ is non-institutional, because Σ-work, interruption rights, and boundary enforcement become personally owned rather than structurally distributed.</li>
			<li>Role positions with higher exit costs and continuity obligations accumulate follow-on costs from delayed correction and drifting criteria, while role positions with lower exit costs can externalize costs into contested distance, non-response, and narrative contestation.</li>
			<li>Irreversible costs concentrate where Θ-amplified drift makes later correction structurally unviable, while relational costs concentrate where Χ is priced and therefore converted into recognition conflict and Λ-mediated channel control.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, personal steering is terminated where it becomes irreversibly expensive to carry unpriced distance and criteria load, and it is continued where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs than temporary carriage. Formalization of mandate, boundaries, criteria, and feedback coupling emerges as a structurally rational consequence when Χ must be made non-personal to prevent Φ and Α_conflict from replacing Σ consolidation under Ω/Θ pressure.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not praise leadership or blame any role position. It does not prescribe a governance model. It describes a mechanical stability condition: without institutionalized Χ, distance becomes priced and contested, and the regime predictably drifts toward narrative substitution, group insurance, and conflict attractor stabilization under asymmetric cost conditions.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 21 — Docking Map: Transitions and Parasitics</h3>
			<p>This chapter provides a paper-internal navigation map that mirrors the stack logic without turning the paper into a procedure. The docking map is a structural adjacency list: which regimes tend to precede CONFLICT, which regimes it tends to feed, and which parallel layers cross-couple or parasitize the same constraint field.</p>
			<p>The docking map is not a reading order and not a method. Its function is to prevent interpretive category errors: applying CONFLICT where CRITIQUE is still structurally viable, treating downstream governance as if it were domain analysis, or importing optional lenses (EDEN/SEX/LOGIC) as if they were required modules.</p>
			<h4>21.1 Canonical transitions (stack-faithful)</h4>
			<p><strong>ANTICIPATION → CRITIQUE.</strong>
			Anticipation stabilizes differentiation before events crystallize. The transition into critique occurs when openness becomes interruptible: the system can still absorb correction without converting correction into compounding loss. The relevant shift is not “people become reasonable,” but that Χ can still function as effective attenuation, and Σ remains a plausible consolidation horizon.</p>
			<p><strong>CRITIQUE → CONFLICT.</strong>
			The transition into conflict occurs when integration collisions persist: Σ cannot consolidate into a shared spine, binding is non-trivial, and exit/interruption becomes costly or asymmetric. Critique can be intense while still being critique. Conflict begins when “repair” attempts compound costs and Φ substitutes for Σ.</p>
			<p><strong>CONFLICT → tragedy / downstream institutionalization.</strong>
			Conflict does not automatically “resolve.” It either drifts toward tragedy handling (non-integrable persistence under mature constraints) or toward downstream institutionalization, where governance layers translate legibility into evaluation, containment, or formal handling. This transition is not a moral escalation. It is a change in stratum: from descriptive legibility to handling regimes.</p>
			<h4>21.2 Parallel layers and cross-coupling</h4>
			<p><strong>EDEN runs parallel and can parasitize CRITIQUE/CONFLICT in a purely functional load-routing sense (non-moral, non-enemy).</strong>
			EDEN is not a dependency for CONFLICT validity. It is an optional lens that can increase legibility of drift patterns where binding, comparison, and asymmetry are re-routed into attractor-safe narratives. “Parasitic” denotes a structural relation: EDEN can ride on critique language and conflict exposure without carrying Σ-work, thereby increasing Φ substitution and stabilizing Α patterns.</p>
			<p><strong>SEX cross-couples into CONFLICT via binding desynchronization and exit realism.</strong>
			SEX is not an essence claim and does not introduce operators. It acts as a cross-anchor because role distributions can correlate with distinct cost profiles (Ω) and binding loads (Ψ) under Θ pressure. This cross-coupling increases legibility where exit costs and carriage positions are persistently asymmetric.</p>
			<p><strong>LOGIC → MIP/IA via the limits of justification.</strong>
			LOGIC anchors the point where justification reaches structural limits and post-moral residue persists. The downstream transition occurs when the system must handle what cannot be integrated discursively. That handling belongs to governance overlays (MIP/IA), not to the CONFLICT layer.</p>
			<h4>21.3 Cross-anchor clause (optional lenses)</h4>
			<p>EDEN/SEX/LOGIC (and other domain layers) appear here as interpretive anchors only. They add no operators, prescribe no actions, and are not required modules for CONFLICT validity. Their sole function is to increase structural legibility of specific drift patterns, under the same validity gate and non-psychological interpretation protocol.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load (map-level):</strong> Χ, Σ, Φ, Θ, Ω, Ψ (Α as stabilization carrier).  </p>
			<h3>21.4 Chapter Closure</h3>
			<h4>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h4>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that the stack must be read as a non-mixing transition graph: ANTICIPATION stabilizes differentiation into CRITIQUE via interruptibility; CRITIQUE transitions into CONFLICT when Σ consolidation fails under binding and costly/asymmetric exit; CONFLICT transitions into tragedy handling or downstream institutionalization when persistence becomes non-integrable. Cross-anchors (EDEN/SEX/LOGIC) are structurally parallel lenses that can increase legibility but cannot carry Σ and cannot be treated as operator-adding modules.</p>
			<h4>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Upstream costs are primarily correction and revision costs while Σ remains viable; these are reversible and distributed by interruptibility regimes.</li>
			<li>In CONFLICT, costs concentrate as follow-on load under Θ and Ω: exit becomes priced, Φ becomes a cheaper substitute than Σ, and drift becomes path-dependent.</li>
			<li>Downstream institutionalization concentrates terminal and liability-adjacent costs in role positions charged with formal handling, while role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs experience prolonged load when non-mixing is violated and domains are misapplied.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h4>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h4>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, transitions are structurally rational when each stratum is used for what it can carry: CRITIQUE is continued where interruption still reduces costs and terminated where “repair” compounding makes it irreversibly expensive; CONFLICT analysis is continued where it increases legibility of persistent incompatibility and terminated where it becomes a covert governance substitute; downstream institutionalization is entered where non-integrability requires formal handling and avoided where it would create higher downstream costs than continued domain-level legibility. Optional cross-anchors are structurally rational when they increase legibility without replacing Σ-work with Φ inflation.</p>
			<h4>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h4>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not prescribe a reading order or an intervention sequence. It does not claim that downstream institutionalization is “better,” or that cross-anchors are “bad.” It describes structural adjacency and misuse risks: non-mixing violations convert legibility into enforcement, treat lenses as modules, and displace costs into Φ substitution and attractor stabilization under asymmetric exit conditions.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 22 — EDEN / SEX / LOGIC: What CONFLICT Borrows, What It Does Not</h3>
			<p>This chapter fixes the relationship between CONFLICT and adjacent domain layers by making borrowing explicit and preventing a common failure mode: outsourcing conflict legibility into other papers and then importing their language back as if it were an operator extension.</p>
			<p>CONFLICT borrows <strong>legibility leverage</strong> from EDEN/SEX/LOGIC in the form of drift signatures that recur under binding, asymmetry, temporality, and costly exit. CONFLICT does not borrow operators, validity gates, or application regimes. The purpose is to sharpen recognition without collapsing strata or turning cross-anchors into hidden toolkits.</p>
			<h4>22.1 Borrowing from SEX: intimacy asymmetry as amplifier (Ω/Θ/Ψ/Χ)</h4>
			<p>SEX is referenced here as a cross-anchor for regimes in which intimacy is not role-free and cannot be reduced to symmetric exchange accounting. The structural contribution is not an ontology claim. It is an amplifier map:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes load-bearing where exposure, rejection cost, and liability are not symmetrical across role positions.</li>
			<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> amplifies because option space shrinks under delayed decisions, deferred exits, and long-tail relational costs.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ (binding)</strong> hardens because commitments and identity-adjacent constraints become expensive to revise.</li>
			<li><strong>Χ (distance / exit)</strong> becomes priced and often asymmetric, turning interruption into a cost-bearing act rather than a stabilizing resource.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this regime, CONFLICT becomes legible earlier because exit realism makes “just interrupt” structurally unavailable. SEX is used to read the <em>cost topology</em> of intimacy-conditioned binding, not to assign causes or traits.</p>
			<h4>22.2 Borrowing from EDEN: comparison, claim, pseudo-symmetry as drift overlay</h4>
			<p>EDEN is referenced here for a specific overlay: when <strong>comparison replaces integration</strong> and pseudo-symmetry becomes a stabilizer. Under conflict conditions, EDEN-like drift patterns often appear as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>comparison/claim loops</strong> that maintain apparent symmetry while displacing real costs,</li>
			<li><strong>pseudo-symmetry</strong> that keeps the surface of exchange intact while Σ-work is avoided,</li>
			<li><strong>narrative substitution (Φ inflation)</strong> that replaces consolidation with positioning.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>EDEN increases legibility of a particular failure: when a system cannot carry the costs of explicit asymmetry, it produces symmetry theater, and conflict persists behind the theater as a cost topology rather than an exchange.</p>
			<h4>22.3 Reciprocity loss as a cross-anchor event: from exchange legibility to cost topology</h4>
			<p>Reciprocity loss is treated here as a marker that becomes especially legible under EDEN drift. The signal is not “unfairness.” The signal is that <strong>reciprocal expectation and exchange legibility collapse</strong>, and attempts to restore symmetry through comparison cease to function as integration.</p>
			<p>Typical structural movement:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>exchange expectations collapse into <strong>cost topology</strong> under <strong>Ω and Θ</strong>,</li>
			<li>Σ-consolidation attempts drift into <strong>Φ substitution</strong> (interpretation replaces carriage),</li>
			<li>stabilization occurs via <strong>Α-patterns</strong> (conflict becomes predictable by repetition rather than resolved by integration).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is why reciprocity loss often accelerates conflict stabilization: it removes the shared accounting space in which “give/take” could still function as a bridge to Σ.</p>
			<h4>22.4 Borrowing from LOGIC: justification limits and post-moral residue fields</h4>
			<p>LOGIC is referenced where justification reaches structural limits. In CONFLICT, this shows up when:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>arguments no longer function as correction vehicles (CRITIQUE regime),</li>
			<li>the residue of non-integrable incompatibility persists even under reflective constraint,</li>
			<li>discourse becomes an arena for Φ rather than a bridge to Σ.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>LOGIC contributes a boundary: there are states where further justification effort is structurally non-productive, not because of irrationality, but because the integration spine is not shared and cannot be rebuilt at acceptable cost.</p>
			<h4>22.5 Non-prescriptive framing: what these references do not do</h4>
			<p>EDEN/SEX/LOGIC are cited here as interpretive anchors only. They do not define procedures, do not supply interventions, and do not authorize governance moves. Their role is to increase legibility of drift signatures already inside CONFLICT’s operator grammar. CONFLICT remains bounded by PMS validity and non-mixing: cross-anchors can clarify, but they cannot carry Σ, cannot lower Χ-exit costs, and cannot reverse Θ path dependence by description alone.</p>
			<p>These operator signatures are <strong>descriptive fingerprints</strong> of drift visibility, <em>not</em> additional operator requirements for CONFLICT and not dependency claims.</p>
			<p>Any cross-anchor reference that collapses distance (Χ), violates reversibility, or is used for person-near evaluation is formally invalid as PMS application.  </p>
			<h4>22.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that EDEN/SEX/LOGIC function as cross-anchor lenses that increase drift legibility under CONFLICT conditions, while CONFLICT remains operator-closed and validity-bound to PMS. The frame shift is from “adjacent papers as alternative explanations” to “adjacent papers as non-operative overlays”: borrowing is permitted only as recognition grammar, and outsourcing is structurally invalid because it collapses strata and smuggles procedures into a domain layer. Σ cannot be restored by cross-anchor reference where Σ is already structurally absent, and Χ/Θ/Ω constraints remain load-bearing.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>Cross-anchor use concentrates benefits in legibility (reduced ambiguity cost) while leaving carriage costs unchanged: Σ-work remains expensive where incompatibility persists.</li>
			<li>Reciprocity loss shifts costs from exchange accounting to cost topology: relational and follow-on costs replace reversible comparison costs, and Φ-substitution becomes cheaper than consolidation.</li>
			<li>Role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs carry prolonged load when pseudo-symmetry displaces integration; role positions close to endpoint and liability costs tend to prefer fast stabilization via Φ and Α because prolonged Σ-work becomes irreversibly expensive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, cross-anchor reference is structurally rational when it increases legibility without being treated as an operator extension or a toolset promise. It is structurally rational to terminate cross-anchor importing where it becomes Φ inflation (interpretation replacing carriage) and to continue it where it makes drift signatures falsifiable and prevents category errors (e.g., treating reciprocity collapse as a “communication problem”). Under binding and costly exit, stabilization via Α patterns and Φ substitution is structurally predictable; the rational envelope describes when these substitutions dominate because Σ is non-viable at acceptable cost, not because of defect.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not assert causal essences, group traits, or prescriptions about what should be done. It does not claim that EDEN/SEX/LOGIC are “true explanations” of particular conflicts. It describes structural borrowing limits: cross-anchors are optional legibility devices, not modules, not interventions, and not authorization for enforcement.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 23 — MIPractice/IA as Downstream Governance Layer (Optional Lens)</h3>
			<p>This chapter introduces MIPractice/IA as a <strong>downstream governance layer</strong> that can receive CONFLICT outputs without contaminating CONFLICT’s operator grammar. The layer is optional: it is not required for CONFLICT validity, and it introduces no new operators. Its sole function is to provide a controlled transmission interface: how a conflict reading can be carried into evaluation contexts without collapsing into moralization, diagnosis, or enforcement theater.</p>
			<p>The strict constraint is: CONFLICT describes structural regimes; MIPractice/IA governs how such descriptions are handled under institutional pressure, publicness scaling, and exposure hardening. The output is not “what is true about persons.” The output is a disciplined way of stating what is structurally visible, what is uncertain, and what becomes risky under misuse.</p>
			<h4>23.1 A–C–R–P–D profiling: bands, not labels</h4>
			<p>MIPractice uses an A–C–R–P–D profile as a compact representation of structural state. The profile is not a trait attribution. It is a state vector derived from observable constraints and drift signatures.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>A / M as bands:</strong> A and M are treated as ranges (bands) rather than points. Bands prevent false precision under incomplete visibility and reduce narrative overreach.</li>
			<li><strong>Trajectories &gt; labels:</strong> the profile must be read as a movement description across time (Θ), not as a fixed classification. The purpose is to capture drift and stabilization, not to assign identity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Symbol collision guard (local):</strong> <em>Latin</em> <strong>A</strong>/<strong>M</strong> here are MIPractice bands (A-band/M-band). They are not PMS operator glyphs, and they are not <em>Greek</em> <strong>Α</strong> (Attractor). Typography is binding: <strong>A</strong> (Latin) ≠ <strong>Α</strong> (Greek).</p>
			<p>Operationally, this means profiles are always presented as: “under these conditions, the system occupies this band,” not as: “this actor is X.”</p>
			<h4>23.2 IA-box: T / J / TB / R as an application boundary</h4>
			<p>The IA-box defines a minimal governance boundary by separating <strong>interpretation</strong> from <strong>application</strong>. The structure is designed to prevent a predictable collapse: treating interpretive outputs as licensing instruments.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>T:</strong> what is structurally testable within the current visibility constraints.</li>
			<li><strong>J:</strong> what is being treated as judgment pressure (often imported by publicness or audience logic).</li>
			<li><strong>TB:</strong> what must be treated as bounded/conditional due to incomplete Σ access or priced Χ.</li>
			<li><strong>R:</strong> what remains unresolved and must not be overwritten by narrative substitution (Φ) or group stabilization (Α_group).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The IA-box is the containment device that prevents “reading” from becoming “permission.”</p>
			<h4>23.3 Application zones: green / yellow / red</h4>
			<p>Application zones formalize where use is structurally safe, structurally risky, or structurally invalid.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Green:</strong> low publicness, bounded exposure, stable Χ availability, and high Σ viability; outputs can be used as coordination scaffolding without turning into enforcement.</li>
			<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> mixed conditions; partial Ψ binding and rising Ω exposure; outputs must be banded, conditionalized, and explicitly limited to avoid Φ inflation.</li>
			<li><strong>Red:</strong> high publicness, audience presence, exposure hardening, and priced/invalid Χ; any “application” becomes structurally prone to pillory logic, pseudo-symmetry theater, or diagnostic misuse.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Zones describe transmission risk; they do not confer authorization, legitimacy, or enforcement mandate. They do not tell anyone what to do; they describe when transmission becomes structurally unsafe.</p>
			<h4>23.4 D-module: default off, scenic, misuse is a drift signal</h4>
			<p>The D-module is treated as a high-risk interpretive tool and is therefore constrained by default-off governance.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Default off:</strong> the system assumes D is disabled unless specific structural conditions warrant its activation within a bounded context.</li>
			<li><strong>Scenic only:</strong> D is used as a scene-level descriptor, not as a global rating.</li>
			<li><strong>No D0 rating:</strong> zeroing is forbidden because it invites false innocence claims and escalates narrative warfare.</li>
			<li><strong>Misuse counts as finding:</strong> if D is used as enforcement, diagnosis, or public humiliation, that misuse is treated as a structural data point about the environment’s drift toward Φ/Α stabilization and exposure hardening.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This makes “tool misuse” a measurable regime signal rather than a moral complaint.</p>
			<h4>23.5 Frame vs variability: system axiom under publicness scaling</h4>
			<p>Under publicness scaling, variability is routinely misread as inconsistency and then exploited as Φ material. The governance layer therefore distinguishes:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Frame state:</strong> which regime is currently operative (□ drift under Θ/Ω/Ψ/Χ constraints).</li>
			<li><strong>Variability:</strong> legitimate fluctuation within a regime that does not imply Σ availability or moral instability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Publicness increases the payoff for narrative coercion. As publicness rises, exposure hardens and the system drifts toward group stabilization and interpretive weaponization:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>publicness ↑ → Φ inflation ↑ → Α_group stabilization ↑ → Χ delegitimization ↑</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not a claim about motives. It is a structural consequence of audience presence and cost displacement.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> PMS outputs and derived axes only; no new operators introduced.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> CONFLICT → MIPractice/IA as a governance overlay for evaluation and exposure hardening.</p>
			<h4>23.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that MIPractice/IA constitutes a strictly downstream interface that can carry CONFLICT readings into evaluation contexts without importing normativity into CONFLICT itself. The frame shift is from “conflict description as self-sufficient” to “conflict description under transmission risk”: once outputs enter publicness and institutional settings, Φ substitution, exposure hardening, and Α_group stabilization become dominant failure modes. Operators inside CONFLICT do not expand; what changes is the structural environment in which outputs are interpreted, priced, and weaponized. Χ availability becomes a gating constraint for safe application, and where Χ is delegitimized, governance becomes the only remaining containment mechanism.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>Transmission costs concentrate under publicness: relational costs and follow-on costs rise as audiences convert partial information into Φ narratives.</li>
			<li>Decision costs shift into downstream liability: the cost of stating uncertainty (banding) and limits (IA-box) is borne by role positions exposed to continuity, while role positions close to endpoint and liability costs preferentially compress ambiguity into decisive-looking claims.</li>
			<li>In red-zone conditions, costs become continuous load: once exposure hardens, attempts to reintroduce Σ via explanation become irreversibly expensive and are displaced into narrative justification.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution, it is structurally rational to treat profiling as banded and trajectory-based rather than label-based, and to route interpretation through an IA boundary that prevents “reading” from becoming licensing. It is structurally rational to terminate certain applications where publicness and hardened exposure make them non-integrable (red zone), and to continue limited application where Χ is available and bounded and where Σ remains viable (green/yellow). Under exposure hardening, formalization (zones, box boundaries, default-off modules) is structurally rational as a containment response, not as an assertion of moral authority.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not prescribe interventions, punishments, or governance actions, and it does not claim that MIPractice/IA can solve conflict. It describes structural conditions under which transmission of conflict readings becomes unsafe and how a governance layer can reduce predictable category errors (diagnosis, enforcement, pillory). No moral preference is implied; the chapter specifies a separation logic between descriptive operators and downstream evaluation environments.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 24 — A&amp;H Precision Overlay (Optional Second-Order)</h3>
			<p>This chapter introduces the A&amp;H Precision overlay as a <strong>second-order quality layer</strong> for MIPractice/IA outputs. It is optional and strictly downstream: it does not change the first-order model (A–C–R–P–D, A/M bands, IA-box), it does not add inference operators, and it does not re-score persons. Its sole function is to keep an analysis <strong>attackable, iterable, and non-immunized</strong> when terms are contested, audiences are present, or transmission risk is high.</p>
			<p>A&amp;H is defined as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>A (Attack-surface visibility):</strong> where the analysis is structurally vulnerable to critique, misread, or misuse.</li>
			<li><strong>H (Hardening backlog):</strong> the smallest next-iteration patches that would reduce those vulnerabilities.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The overlay prevents a common failure mode in public or institutional settings: analyses become rhetorically sealed (Φ-protected) rather than structurally precise, and critique is treated as hostility rather than as a signal of missing conditions.</p>
			<h4>24.1 Precision Heuristic (PH): banding analysis robustness without turning it into a score war</h4>
			<p>The overlay uses a compact <strong>Precision Heuristic (PH)</strong> band (low / mixed / high). PH is not a truth claim. It is a visibility claim: how well the analysis currently satisfies minimal precision requirements such that it can be <strong>revised without humiliation</strong>, challenged without moral escalation, and transmitted without silently becoming a weapon.</p>
			<p>PH is derived from a small set of dimensions (e.g., term definition, scope boundaries, conditions/thresholds, evidence vs inference separation, reversibility clause, language hygiene). The result is banded to avoid false precision.</p>
			<p>PH governs only the <strong>expected confidence posture</strong> of the report:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Low PH → increased uncertainty posture; higher misuse risk; stronger need for banding, scope tightening, and reversibility clauses.</li>
			<li>High PH → more stable transmission; critique becomes productive rather than identity-threatening.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PH does not “validate” an analysis. It makes its epistemic posture explicit.</p>
			<h4>24.2 Attack points: making vulnerabilities explicit without turning critique into person-judgment</h4>
			<p>Attack points are the standardized list of where the analysis is vulnerable. They target <strong>the artifact</strong>, not actors in the case.</p>
			<p>Typical attack point classes include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>term ambiguity</strong> (key terms not defined; scope/exclusions missing),</li>
			<li><strong>scope leakage</strong> (role/context/publicness not pinned; scene drifts into person-typing),</li>
			<li><strong>evidence gap</strong> (observation vs inference not separated),</li>
			<li><strong>missing conditions</strong> (no if/then thresholds; claims look absolute),</li>
			<li><strong>missing reversibility</strong> (no update clause; analysis reads as final),</li>
			<li><strong>publicity collapse risk</strong> (language likely to be weaponized under audience presence),</li>
			<li><strong>dignity language risk</strong> (phrasing invites shaming or D inflation).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Attack points are written in dignity-preserving language and framed as <em>patchable weaknesses</em>, not as failure signals.</p>
			<h4>24.3 Hardening backlog: minimal next iteration patches (no annotation spiral)</h4>
			<p>For each attack point, the overlay produces a <strong>hardening backlog</strong>: the smallest next-iteration patches that would reduce vulnerability.</p>
			<p>Hardening patches are deliberately minimal:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>define one contested term,</li>
			<li>add one scope boundary (role / frame / publicness),</li>
			<li>add one if/then condition,</li>
			<li>separate observation from evaluation in one paragraph,</li>
			<li>add one reversibility clause,</li>
			<li>add one counter-reading outline,</li>
			<li>add one publicness guardrail sentence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The constraint is <strong>bounded recursion</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>no “notes on notes,”</li>
			<li>no infinite meta-commentary,</li>
			<li>at most a small number of attack points and patches per iteration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The goal is to keep the analysis <strong>iterable</strong> instead of immunized.</p>
			<h4>24.4 Why this protects the domain layer against narrative immunization</h4>
			<p>In contested or public settings, analyses tend to drift into one of two failures:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>immunization</strong>: ambiguity is used to avoid correction while preserving rhetorical dominance (Φ inflation);</li>
			<li><strong>weaponization</strong>: partial readings are treated as licensing instruments for enforcement, shame, or group stabilization.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The A&amp;H overlay blocks both by making (i) precision posture explicit and (ii) vulnerabilities visible and patchable. It therefore increases critique-readiness without converting critique into morality play.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> meta-layer only (no new inference operators; consumes structured fields).
			<strong>Docking:</strong> protects domain layers by keeping governance artifacts critique-ready and non-immunized under publicness.</p>
			<h4>24.5 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that a second-order precision overlay can harden MIPractice/IA outputs against two predictable drift modes under publicness: narrative immunization (Φ inflation) and weaponized transmission. The overlay does not modify first-order readings; it makes their attack surfaces explicit and defines minimal next-iteration hardening actions, preserving reversibility and critique-readiness.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<ul>
			<li>Precision costs concentrate at the artifact boundary: defining terms, stating scope, and marking inference requires short-term effort but reduces downstream costs of misread and escalation.</li>
			<li>Under audience presence, ambiguity becomes expensive: unbounded interpretation work and reputational exposure increase follow-on costs for role positions tasked with continuity and responsibility.</li>
			<li>Hardening shifts costs forward: small patches reduce later escalation costs where correction would otherwise become irreversibly expensive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric transmission risk, it is structurally rational to (i) band confidence (PH), (ii) surface attack points, and (iii) maintain a minimal hardening backlog, especially in yellow/red-leaning publicness conditions. It is structurally rational to terminate recursion when the next marginal annotation would create an annotation spiral rather than a patchable improvement.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not evaluate persons and does not turn critique into a moral verdict. It does not re-score first-order A/M/IA/D results and does not authorize enforcement. It describes an optional quality overlay that makes analysis vulnerabilities explicit and preserves reversibility, dignity-preserving language, and critique readiness under transmission pressure.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h3>Chapter 25 — Application Boundary Note (Mandatory if Any Application Lens Is Used)</h3>
			<p>This chapter is a boundary device. It exists to prevent a predictable failure mode: treating a descriptive structural model as an operational toolset, and then backfilling legitimacy through the model’s vocabulary. If any application lens is activated (MIPractice, A&amp;H, or downstream governance), the boundary becomes structurally load-bearing, because publicness and exposure can convert interpretive language into enforcement affordances.</p>
			<h4>25.1 What this paper does not do</h4>
			<p>This paper does not:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>provide mediation procedures or intervention scripts,</li>
			<li>provide diagnostic criteria for persons, groups, or relationships,</li>
			<li>provide selection rules for who should lead, who should exit, or who should be trusted,</li>
			<li>authorize public pillory, reputational enforcement, or “structural verdicts,”</li>
			<li>provide a child-assessment or family-evaluation framework,</li>
			<li>convert conflict reading into entitlement to demand, punish, compel, or “correct.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The object of the paper is structural legibility: how incompatibility stabilizes under binding, time, and cost, and how operators drift under load. It is not an instruction manual.</p>
			<h4>25.2 Red zones (non-transfer conditions)</h4>
			<p>The following are red zones where transferring the framework into action becomes structurally high-risk:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Coercion and compelled compliance:</strong> using the vocabulary to force consent, silence, access, or participation.</li>
			<li><strong>Moral ranking:</strong> using structural terms to rank persons as superior/inferior, mature/immature, worthy/unworthy.</li>
			<li><strong>Person-labeling and identity capture:</strong> treating drift signatures as trait claims, diagnoses, or stable identity assignments.</li>
			<li><strong>Ψ→Other enforcement patterns:</strong> converting binding language into obligations imposed on others (“you are bound, therefore you owe/submit”), especially under publicness.</li>
			<li><strong>High publicness / high audience coupling:</strong> contexts where groups, platforms, or institutions stabilize narratives and punish revision.</li>
			<li><strong>Low reversibility environments:</strong> where a claim, once made, becomes costly to retract (Θ and Ω harden).</li>
			<li><strong>High misuse-gradient contexts:</strong> where the language predictably becomes diagnosis theater, enforcement theater, or reputational weaponization.</li>
			<li><strong>Asymmetric exposure settings:</strong> where one role position can impose visibility while another carries downstream costs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In these contexts, even accurate structural descriptions can function as coercive instruments because the environment converts language into irreversible pressure.</p>
			<h4>25.3 PMS entry condition (validity gate for any application)</h4>
			<p>Χ + reversibility + D</p>
			<p>Any application use is structurally valid only where distance (Χ) is preserved as a constraint, reversibility remains real, and dignity-in-practice (D) constrains language and exposure. Where any of these drop out, application drifts into governance theater and becomes structurally illegible as PMS.</p>
			<h4>25.4 Application lens declaration block (mode / publicness / misuse gradient)</h4>
			<p>Where any application lens is present, transmissible artifacts require an explicit declaration block that bounds scope:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>Mode declaration:</strong> descriptive (CONFLICT) or evaluation overlay (MIPractice / A&amp;H).</li>
			<li><strong>Publicness level:</strong> private / semi-public / public, stated as a boundary condition.</li>
			<li><strong>Misuse gradient classification:</strong> low / mixed / high, stated explicitly as a transmission risk modifier.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This declaration block is not a disclaimer. It is a structural constraint that reduces scope creep and blocks default drift from description into prescriptive authority.</p>
			<h4>25.5 Minimal safe reuse constraint (paper → excerpt)</h4>
			<p>Because excerpts travel, reuse is structurally safer when any excerpt containing operator language also carries, in compressed form:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>the “does not do” block (25.1),</li>
			<li>the red-zone statement that publicness and low reversibility convert claims into enforcement affordances,</li>
			<li>the mode/publicness/misuse declaration if any governance overlay is invoked.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Without these, excerpts become structururally prone to pseudo-symmetry, moral substitution, person-labeling, and narrative immunization: readers treat the vocabulary as license rather than as constraint.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> guardrails only (no inference operators).
			<strong>Docking:</strong> converts paper output into bounded reuse by forcing explicit mode, exposure, and misuse classification when application lenses are present.</p>
			<h4>25.6 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that introducing any application lens shifts the text from a descriptive object to a transferable instrument under exposure. Under that shift, operator language gains enforcement affordances unless scope, mode, and publicness are explicitly bounded. What becomes non-integrable is implicit transfer: if application is present without declared mode, publicness level, and misuse gradient, downstream readings drift into prescriptive interpretation by default. The boundary device establishes that the model’s vocabulary does not carry authorization for action.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>In low-publicness contexts, costs are primarily reversible decision costs: misreads can be corrected without compounding exposure. In semi-public/public contexts, costs become continuous and relational: statements function as persistent records, revision becomes structurally expensive under Θ and Ω, and interpretive claims begin to behave like pressure. Role positions that bear continuity and relational costs carry the downstream load of misapplication, while role positions closer to endpoint and liability costs preferentially compress ambiguity into decisive-looking claims that raise misuse gradients.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under asymmetric cost distribution and increasing publicness, it is structurally rational for artifacts to formalize boundaries: declare mode, classify publicness, classify misuse gradient, and explicitly mark red zones where transfer becomes structurally unviable. It is structurally rational to terminate application framing where reversibility is low and misuse gradient is high, because additional articulation becomes irreversibly expensive and converts analysis into pressure. Under high misuse gradients, strict guardrails function as cost containment, not as moral posture.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not assert who is right, who should lead, who should exit, or what anyone ought to do. It does not provide diagnostic or enforcement authority. It describes how exposure, reversibility, and misuse gradients structurally convert interpretive language into coercive affordances, and why explicit boundary declarations are required when application overlays are invoked.</p>

			<h3>Chapter 26 — Terminal Claim (Structural Full Stop)</h3>
			<p>Within the PMS-domain stack used here, CONFLICT is the terminal domain layer: beyond maximal Δ–Ψ load under Θ/Ω/Χ, the model yields no further internal reintegration grammar—only downstream governance, institutionalization, decision, or evaluation.</p>
			<p>This chapter marks the end of the PMS-domain stack for CONFLICT. The claim is not rhetorical and not motivational. It is a boundary definition: the operator grammar reaches a terminal regime where additional praxis grammar does not emerge from the model itself.</p>
			<p>The terminal condition can be stated as a stack claim:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>As Σ-consolidation fails under sustained incompatibility, the system does not generate a new internal operator that restores integrability.</li>
			<li>Under increasing Θ (path dependence) and Ω (exposure asymmetry), exit and reflective distance (Χ) become structurally expensive or asymmetric.</li>
			<li>The attractor field stabilizes: Φ-substitution and Α_conflict become the default stabilizers when Σ is no longer carrying.</li>
			<li>At that point, legibility can still increase, but integrability does not. The model continues to describe, but it stops producing internal reintegration affordances.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This paper does not continue into solutions. It ends where praxis becomes tragically legible but no longer integrable.</p>
			<p><strong>Operators under load:</strong> Σ, Θ, Ω, Ψ, Χ.
			<strong>Docking:</strong> stabilizes PMS as a finite system; strengthens the CONFLICT → MIP/IA transition by making the handoff explicit as a mode shift rather than a continuation.</p>
			<h4>26.1 Chapter Closure</h4>
			<h5>(1) Structural Result (Condensation)</h5>
			<p>From the described constellation, it follows structurally that the operator stack reaches a terminal regime: Σ no longer carries, and no additional internal operator emerges that reconstitutes integrability under maximal Θ/Ω/Ψ with costly or asymmetric Χ. The frame shifts from “integration-possible under load” to “legibility without reintegration.” What becomes non-integrable is the attempt to read further procedure from the descriptive grammar itself; beyond the terminal condition, continuation inside the same grammar is non-integrable.</p>
			<h5>(2) Cost Distribution (Cost Topology)</h5>
			<p>Role positions close to endpoint and liability costs respond differently from role positions exposed to continuity and relational costs.</p>
			<p>Irreversible costs concentrate where Θ has already collapsed option space and where Χ requires high exit or reflection costs; the load becomes terminal because the price of reversal is structurally unavailable. Relational and continuous costs concentrate where Ψ remains active (binding persists) while Σ is absent as consolidator; the system continues to generate follow-on load without integration payoff. Decision costs concentrate near endpoint-setting positions that can declare closure, institutionalize rules, or externalize evaluation, while follow-on costs concentrate in positions that must carry continuity under unresolved incompatibility.</p>
			<h5>(3) Rational Response Envelope (Structural Rationality)</h5>
			<p>Under terminal asymmetric cost distribution, it is structurally rational for governance and evaluation layers to appear as externalizations: formalization, institutionalization, mandate-setting, or withdrawal become the rational response envelope when internal reintegration is structurally unviable. Under maximal load, mediation termination is rational where continued integration attempts become irreversibly expensive, and continued structured handling is rational where withdrawal would generate higher downstream costs through Ψ-coupling and Θ-amplified residues. The handoff to downstream layers is a consequence of terminal conditions, not a defect in description.</p>
			<h5>(4) Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)</h5>
			<p>This description makes no claims about character, guilt, or normative preference. It does not imply what should be done, what is fair, or who is responsible in a moral sense. It does not claim that “solutions are impossible” as a moral or motivational statement. It describes a structural boundary: when Σ fails under Θ/Ω/Ψ with costly or asymmetric Χ, the model ceases to generate internal integration grammar and any continuation becomes downstream governance or evaluation rather than further descriptive reintegration within PMS-CONFLICT.</p>

			<h2>Appendices</h2>
			<h3>A. Glossary + Term Definitions</h3>
			<p>Below is a <strong>consolidated glossary</strong> extracted by sweeping <strong>all chapters of PMS-CONFLICT</strong>.
			Terms are <strong>structural</strong>, <strong>non-psychological</strong>, and <strong>scene-bound</strong>, consistent with the paper’s validity gates.</p>
			<h4><strong>Α (Attractor — recurrent stabilization)</strong></h4>
			<p>A recurrent stabilization pattern produced by repeated framed interactions and non-events. In CONFLICT, attractors explain persistence without escalation or intention claims.</p>
			<h4><strong>Α_conflict (conflict attractor)</strong></h4>
			<p>A paper-local configuration label for an attractor regime in which conflict itself becomes the stabilizing orientation field. Not a new operator.</p>
			<h4><strong>Α_group (group-level attractor)</strong></h4>
			<p>A group-level attractor that stabilizes trajectories via diffusion, delegated judgment, and narrative safety when individual integration becomes unaffordable.</p>
			<h4><strong>ANTICIPATION (domain layer)</strong></h4>
			<p>Upstream domain layer concerned with pre-event differentiation and expectation load before binding or conflict crystallizes.</p>
			<h4><strong>Ω (Asymmetry — exposure and cost gradient)</strong></h4>
			<p>Structural imbalance in exposure, capacity, liability, or decision authority. Ω describes cost gradients, not moral hierarchy.</p>
			<h4><strong>Attack Surface</strong></h4>
			<p>A predictable point where structural language can drift into misuse (moralization, person-typing, enforcement) under exposure or publicness.</p>
			<h4><strong>A&amp;H Precision Overlay</strong></h4>
			<p>A second-order quality layer used downstream (e.g., MIPractice) to surface attack points and define minimal hardening patches. Does not alter first-order analysis.</p>
			<h4><strong>Binding (Ψ-effect under Θ)</strong></h4>
			<p>Constraint fixation that makes reversal non-neutral in cost terms. Binding is structural commitment, not preference or intention.</p>
			<h4><strong>Chapter Closure</strong></h4>

			<h4><strong>Χ (Distance — interruptibility / stop-capability)</strong></h4>
			<p>Reflective withdrawal that prevents coercion and preserves validity. Χ is a constraint condition, not avoidance or superiority.</p>
			<h4><strong>Drift</strong></h4>
			<p>Unmarked transition of frames or regimes under operator pressure. Drift is normal; failure occurs when drift is unrecognized.</p>
			<h4><strong>EDEN (domain layer)</strong></h4>
			<p>A parallel domain layer that increases legibility of comparison drift, pseudo-symmetry, and reciprocity loss. Optional lens only.</p>
			<h4><strong>Emotional Coercion</strong></h4>

			<p>Collapse of exchange legibility where cost topology replaces comparative accounting.</p>
			<h4><strong>Φ (Recontextualization — frame shift)</strong></h4>
