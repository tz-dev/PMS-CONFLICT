## Example 1: Binding Without Integrability

### I. Reduced PMS-CONFLICT Signature (Threshold Marker)

**Reduced signature:**
`Σ ↓  +  Ψ ↑  +  Ω ↑  +  Θ ↑  +  Χ priced`

**Reading discipline:**
This signature is **not a proof chain**. It marks the **terminal conflict threshold** where:

* **Σ (integration)** no longer consolidates shared continuation,
* **Ψ (binding)** persists and intensifies despite Σ failure,
* **Ω (asymmetry)** differentiates cost exposure across roles,
* **Θ (temporality)** hardens prior commitments into sunk costs,
* **Χ (distance)** remains formally available but becomes *priced* or delegitimized.

This configuration satisfies the **PMS-CONFLICT terminal core condition**:

> incompatibility stabilized under binding, time, cost, and constrained distance.

### J. Conflict Domain Classification (PMS-CONFLICT)

**Domain status:**
**CONFLICT (terminal descriptive regime)**

**Justification:**

* The system no longer possesses an **internal reintegration grammar**.
* Further Σ attempts **increase cost** without restoring viability.
* Continuation persists **only via obligation maintenance**, not coordination.
* Exit, pause, or reframing (**Χ**) is structurally discouraged through cost attribution.

This marks the transition from **CRITIQUE failure** to **CONFLICT stabilization**.

### K. Asymmetry Lock-In Analysis (Ω × Θ)

**Asymmetry form:**

* Not dominance or coercion,
* but **differential exposure to maintenance costs over time**.

**Lock-in mechanism:**

* Under **Θ**, revising or releasing Ψ becomes more expensive than carrying incoherence.
* Under **Ω**, continuity roles pay repeatedly; declaration roles pay once.
* The system therefore selects the **cheapest stable configuration**:
  binding without integration.

This is a **structural attractor**, not a strategic choice.

### L. χ-Availability Test (Distance Under Load)

**Formal status:** Χ exists
**Effective status:** Χ is **priced**

Indicators:

* Distance is rhetorically available (“we can talk anytime”),
* but practically punished (loss of trust, reliability framing, escalation risk).
* Attempts to activate Χ increase exposure rather than reducing load.

This satisfies the PMS-CONFLICT condition:

> distance remains nominal but no longer functions as a stabilizer.

---

### M. Tragedy Clause (Non-Correctability)

This configuration is **tragic in the PMS sense**, meaning:

* No further internal operator rearrangement can restore integrability.
* There is **no missing insight**, **no better framing**, **no moral correction** that reopens Σ at acceptable cost.
* Any continuation requires a **mode shift**:
  governance, institutionalization, adjudication, or exit.

This is **not pessimism** — it is a **boundary condition** of the descriptive grammar.

---

### N. Terminal Structural Closure (PMS-CONFLICT)

Once **Ψ outlives Σ** under **Ω across Θ**, conflict no longer announces itself through disagreement.
It stabilizes as **continuity without meaning**.

What looks like reliability is structurally obligation inertia.
What looks like commitment is cost avoidance under irreversibility.
What looks like cooperation is the absence of an affordable stop.

At this point:

* Further integration talk is **Φ-substitution**,
* further binding is **Ψ amplification without coordination**,
* and further patience accelerates **Θ-hardening**.

Conflict here is not a failure to try harder.
It is the **point at which trying has become the cheapest way to avoid admitting non-integrability**.
