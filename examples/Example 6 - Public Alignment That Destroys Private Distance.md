## Example 6: Public Alignment That Destroys Private Distance

**Case label:** *Consensus Performance under Audience Load*
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no attribution, no prescriptions. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

---

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**

* **Θ (temporality):** Rapid escalation with durable public records.
* **□ (frame anchor):** **□public alignment** (unity, consensus, solidarity).
* **Roles (not persons):**

  * Role R₁: visibility carrier; statements are indexed, persistent, and attributable.
  * Role R₂: narrative beneficiary; gains from public unity without equivalent exposure.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**

* **Δ:** Call for immediate public alignment appears.
* **∇:** Pressure to demonstrate unity under audience scrutiny.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**

* Private negotiation space.
* Delayed response windows.
* Explicit separation between public signaling and private coordination.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* Public statements of unity.
* Suppression of internal disagreement.
* Acceleration of symbolic consensus.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`P → Ω amplification → Χ collapse → Α_group → Σ impossible → Ψ performative`

**Key transitions:**

* **P (publicness overlay)** amplifies exposure and irreversibility.
* **Ω (asymmetry)** intensifies as visibility and liability diverge.
* **Χ (distance)** collapses; pause or revision becomes reputationally costly.
* **Α (attractor)** stabilizes group-alignment scripts.
* **Σ (integration)** becomes impossible without private distance.
* **Ψ (binding)** shifts to performative loyalty rather than coordinated obligation.

---

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Exposure vs. coordination costs:**

* **R₁-adjacent costs:** reputational risk, irreversible attribution, escalation liability.
* **R₂-adjacent costs:** narrative gain with limited downside.

**System effect:**

* Public alignment reallocates costs while eliminating negotiation space.

---

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Structurally rational responses include:

* **Performative agreement** where dissent would escalate exposure.
* **Silence** to avoid irreversible commitment.
* **Exit** once alignment demands exceed affordable distance.

These responses follow cost logic under **P-amplified Ω across Θ**, not conviction strength.

### E. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under P)

**Risk point:**

* Public unity rhetoric penalizes restraint and reflection.

**Failure mode:**

* **Χ** framed as betrayal or disloyalty.
* **Ψ→Other:** alignment demanded as proof of belonging.

**Structural indicator:**

* Distance increases exposure instead of reducing it.

---

### F. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example does **not** claim:

* that consensus is undesirable,
* that unity implies insincerity,
* that public coordination is illegitimate,
* that disagreement implies bad faith.

It **does claim**:

* that publicness can destroy the conditions for integration,
* that alignment can substitute for coordination,
* that exposure economics reshape viability.

---

### G. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Application is PMS-valid **only if**:

* private **Χ (distance)** remains protected,
* public alignment does not enforce binding,
* reversibility is preserved,
* **D (dignity-in-practice)** constrains shaming and exclusion.

---

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

Public alignment fails here not because disagreement exists,
but because **distance cannot survive under audience economics**.

Under **P**, **Ω** and **Θ** amplify faster than integration can occur.
Consensus becomes performance.
Binding becomes spectacle.
Coordination disappears.

Conflict stabilizes not through opposition,
but through **the loss of any private space where integration could still occur**.

### I. Reduced PMS-CONFLICT Signature

`P ↑  +  Ω ↑  +  Χ collapse  +  Α_group  +  Σ impossible`

---

### J. Conflict Domain Classification

**Domain status:** **CONFLICT (terminal descriptive regime)**
**Justification:** Publicness eliminates distance; no internal reintegration grammar remains available.
