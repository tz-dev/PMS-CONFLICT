## Example 3: Forced Integration after Irreversible Frame Break

**Case label:** *“Let’s Fix It” after Σ Has Already Collapsed*
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no attribution, no prescriptions. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**

* **Θ (temporality):** Extended conflict history with multiple prior repair attempts; consequences of earlier failures have accumulated and hardened.
* **□ (frame anchor):** Initial **□integration** (shared sense-making and coordination), later replaced by **□post-hoc repair narrative** (“we need to fix this now”).
* **Roles (not persons):**

  * Role R₁: invested in restoring coherence and continuity; proximity to repair labor.
  * Role R₂: internally exited integration; proximity to endpoint decisions and disengagement.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**

* **Δ:** A renewed proposal to “finally integrate” or “clear everything up” appears.
* **∇:** Pressure to resolve the situation before further deterioration or loss.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**

* Explicit acknowledgment that prior integration attempts failed.
* Explicit recognition of irreversibility under elapsed **Θ**.
* Explicit release from earlier coordination expectations.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* Escalated repair language (“now or never,” “we owe it to each other”).
* Selective reframing of history to emphasize effort over outcome.
* Absence of structural change enabling renewed **Σ**.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Σ failed → Θ hardening → Φ repair narrative → Ψ forced → Α_coercive stability → Χ erosion`

**Key transitions:**

* **Σ (integration)** has already failed to consolidate shared meaning or coordination.
* **Θ** hardens this failure: past attempts become sunk costs rather than revisable steps.
* **Φ (recontextualization)** reframes failure as unfinished business rather than closure.
* **Ψ (binding)** is reasserted or forced despite the absence of integrability.
* **Α (attractor)** stabilizes coercive repair scripts (“we must fix this”).
* **Χ (distance)** erodes as refusal is framed as avoidance or bad faith.

---

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Irreversible vs. relational costs:**

* **R₁-adjacent costs:** repeated emotional, cognitive, and coordination labor; exposure to renewed disappointment and responsibility for outcome.
* **R₂-adjacent costs:** minimal; exit costs are deferred by demanding renewed effort from others.

**Cost asymmetry pattern:**

* Repair costs concentrate on the role still oriented toward integration.
* Exit costs are externalized by reframing disengagement as temporary or negotiable.

**System effect:**

* Forced integration converts acknowledged failure into durable load rather than closure.

---

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Under this configuration, the following responses are **structurally rational** (not normatively preferred):

* **Symbolic participation** that satisfies repair demands without reopening real integration.
* **Surface agreement** where disagreement would trigger escalation.
* **Withdrawal** where renewed **Σ** would be terminally expensive.

These responses follow cost logic under **Σ failure across Θ with coerced Ψ**, not sincerity or intention.

---

### E. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Φ/Ψ)

**Risk point:**

* Repair language becomes coercive when it denies irreversibility.

**Failure mode:**

* **Ψ→Other:** binding is imposed as obligation to repair, not chosen continuation.
* **Χ** reframed as irresponsibility, coldness, or refusal to heal.

**Structural indicator:**

* Distance is treated as moral defect rather than as recognition of non-integrability.

---

### F. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example does **not** claim:

* that repair is undesirable,
* that effort is irrational,
* that disengagement implies bad faith,
* that any role is morally superior.

It **does claim**:

* that integration cannot be restarted once **Σ** has structurally failed under **Θ**,
* that repair narratives can function as cost denial,
* that coercion can arise through appeals to healing rather than force.

---

### G. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any attempt to *use* this analysis is PMS-valid **only if**:

* **Χ (distance)** remains practically activatable without sanction,
* prior **Σ failure** and irreversibility under **Θ** are nameable,
* binding remains **Ψ→Self**, not enforced **Ψ→Other**,
* **D (dignity-in-practice)** constrains repair language and exposure.

Absent these conditions, application becomes structurally invalid.

---

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

Once **Σ** has failed under **Θ**, renewed integration attempts do not reopen coordination.
They function as **retroactive cost denial**, reframing irreversibility as unfinished effort.

Under this regime:

* **Φ** substitutes for integration,
* **Ψ** amplifies obligation without restoring coherence,
* **Χ** is delegitimized to keep the repair script running.

Conflict here is not sustained by disagreement.
It is sustained by the refusal to acknowledge that **integration has already become structurally unaffordable**.

---

### I. Reduced PMS-CONFLICT Signature (Threshold Marker)

**Reduced signature:**
`Σ = 0  +  Θ ↑  +  Φ ↑  +  Ψ ↑ (forced)  +  Ω implicit  +  Χ priced`

**Reading discipline:**
This signature marks a terminal conflict configuration where:

* integration is no longer possible,
* time hardens failure into irreversibility,
* narrative repair replaces coordination,
* binding persists through pressure,
* distance remains nominal but costly.

---

### J. Conflict Domain Classification (PMS-CONFLICT)

**Domain status:**
**CONFLICT (terminal descriptive regime)**

**Justification:**

* No internal operator rearrangement restores **Σ** at acceptable cost.
* Continued repair attempts increase load without enabling reintegration.
* Any continuation requires a mode shift (exit, governance, adjudication).

---

### K. Asymmetry Lock-In Analysis (Ω × Θ)

**Asymmetry form:**

* Differential exposure to repair labor and emotional risk.

**Lock-in mechanism:**

* Under **Θ**, reopening integration is costlier than maintaining the repair narrative.
* Under implicit **Ω**, one role absorbs repeated effort while the other preserves exit optionality.
* The system stabilizes around coercive repair as the cheapest visible alternative to closure.

---

### L. χ-Availability Test (Distance Under Load)

**Formal status:** Χ exists
**Effective status:** Χ is **priced**

Indicators:

* Refusal to re-integrate triggers escalation or moral framing.
* Pausing increases pressure rather than reducing load.
* Distance is tolerated only rhetorically, not practically.

---

### M. Tragedy Clause (Non-Correctability)

This configuration is tragic in the PMS sense:

* No further clarification, effort, or goodwill restores integrability.
* Repair has become structurally performative rather than corrective.
* Resolution requires exit or downstream handling, not better integration.

---

### N. Terminal Structural Closure (PMS-CONFLICT)

When integration is demanded **after** it has already failed, conflict stabilizes through **coercive repair**.
What appears as commitment to healing functions as denial of irreversibility.

At this point:

* integration talk increases cost without reopening coordination,
* binding enforces continuity without meaning,
* distance becomes the primary threat to system stability.

This outcome is not caused by unwillingness to fix things.
It is the predictable result of insisting on **Σ** where **Θ** has already closed the window of integration.
