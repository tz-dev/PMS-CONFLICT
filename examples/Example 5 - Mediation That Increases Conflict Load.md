## Example 5: Mediation That Increases Conflict Load

**Case label:** *When Mediation Becomes a Cost Multiplier*
**Scope discipline:** Structural mapping only. No diagnosis, no attribution, no prescriptions. PMS application validity remains conditional on **Χ + reversibility + D**.

### A. Scene Packet (Minimal Unit)

**Scene ID:**

* **Θ (temporality):** Late-stage interaction; prior repair attempts have failed and accumulated residue.
* **□ (frame anchor):** **□mediation**, introduced after internal reintegration has already collapsed.
* **Roles (not persons):**

  * Role R₁: continuity carrier; absorbs ongoing interaction, explanation, and coordination load.
  * Role R₂: endpoint setter; controls termination, escalation, or institutional handoff.

**Trigger (Δ/∇):**

* **Δ:** Formal mediation is proposed or imposed as a corrective step.
* **∇:** Pressure to “try one more time” to demonstrate reasonableness or good faith.

**Λ candidates (expected but missing):**

* Explicit acknowledgment that prior integration attempts failed structurally.
* Explicit assessment of remaining Σ viability.
* Explicit recognition of asymmetric exit and continuation costs.

**Observed realizations (neutral):**

* Scheduling of mediation sessions.
* Repetition of already-articulated positions.
* Escalating procedural complexity without consolidation.

### B. Drift Trace (Operator-Readable)

`Σ absent → Φ_mediation → Θ amplification → Ω cost asymmetry → Α_conflict → Χ erosion`

**Key transitions:**

* **Σ (integration)** is already absent; no shared consolidation spine exists.
* **Φ (recontextualization)** reframes terminal conflict as “processable” via mediation.
* **Θ** amplifies sunk costs: each additional round increases irreversibility.
* **Ω** emerges as asymmetry: one role bears continuation costs while the other retains closure control.
* **Α (attractor)** stabilizes conflict-management routines without resolution.
* **Χ (distance)** erodes as refusal of mediation is framed as obstruction.

### C. Cost Distribution (Structural, Not Moral)

**Irreversible vs. procedural costs:**

* **R₁-adjacent costs:** time, emotional labor, preparation, repetition, exposure to renewed conflict.
* **R₂-adjacent costs:** minimal; mediation delays closure without increasing liability.

**Cost asymmetry pattern:**

* Mediation costs accumulate linearly for continuity roles.
* Endpoint roles preserve optionality at low marginal cost.

**System effect:**

* Mediation converts terminal conflict into prolonged load rather than reducing it.

---

### D. Rational Response Envelope (Structural Reasonableness)

Under this configuration, the following responses are **structurally rational**:

* **Participation without expectation of integration**, to avoid immediate sanctions.
* **Strategic withdrawal** where continued participation compounds irreversible loss.
* **Refusal of further mediation** once continuation becomes more expensive than termination.

These responses follow cost logic under **Σ absence across Θ with asymmetric Ω**, not cooperation deficits.

---

### E. Dignity-in-Practice Stress Test (D under Φ/Θ)

**Risk point:**

* Mediation rhetoric frames endurance as virtue and refusal as bad faith.

**Failure mode:**

* **Ψ→Other:** obligation to continue is imposed externally.
* **Χ** reframed as unwillingness to cooperate rather than as cost containment.

**Structural indicator:**

* Distance is punished despite absence of integrative capacity.

### F. Reader-Guard (Misinterpretation Prevention)

This example does **not** claim:

* that mediation is inherently ineffective,
* that refusal indicates hostility,
* that continuation is irrational,
* that any role is morally deficient.

It **does claim**:

* that mediation can function as **Φ without Σ**,
* that late-stage mediation can increase conflict load,
* that continuation may be structurally irrational even when intentions are cooperative.

---

### G. PMS Validity Check (Application Gate)

Any attempt to *use* this analysis is PMS-valid **only if**:

* terminality of Σ is nameable,
* **Χ (distance)** can be exercised without sanction,
* mediation is not used to externalize binding,
* **D (dignity-in-practice)** constrains endurance demands.

### H. Structural Closure (Non-Normative)

When mediation is applied after integrability has collapsed, it does not restore coordination.
It **extends conflict**.

Under **Θ**, each additional mediation cycle raises the cost of exit.
Under **Ω**, continuity roles absorb expanding load while endpoint roles preserve control.
**Χ** is threatened not by aggression, but by procedural moralization.

Mediation fails here not because parties refuse to cooperate,
but because **structural affordability has already ended**.

### I. Reduced PMS-CONFLICT Signature

`Σ absent  +  Φ_mediation  +  Θ amplification  +  Ω asymmetric costs  +  Α_conflict`

---

### J. Conflict Domain Classification

**Domain status:** **CONFLICT (terminal descriptive regime)**
**Justification:** No internal reintegration grammar remains; further mediation amplifies cost without restoring Σ.
